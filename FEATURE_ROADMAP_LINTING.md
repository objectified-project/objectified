## 🎯 Schema Validation & Quality Scoring (NEW)

> **Priority**: 🔴 Critical | **Timeline**: Q1 2026 | **Effort**: 2 weeks

### Real-Time Schema Quality Score

**Quality Score Dashboard** 📋 PLANNED
- 📋 Overall schema quality score (0-100) displayed prominently in Studio header
- 📋 Real-time score updates as schema is modified
- 📋 Historical score tracking with trend chart
- 📋 Score breakdown by category:
    - 📋 **Design Quality** (30 points): Naming conventions, consistency, reusability
    - 📋 **Documentation** (20 points): Descriptions, examples, external docs
    - 📋 **API Best Practices** (25 points): RESTful patterns, proper HTTP methods, status codes
    - 📋 **Security** (15 points): Authentication, authorization, input validation
    - 📋 **Performance** (10 points): Pagination, filtering, caching headers

| Ticket | Feature Description                              |
|--------|--------------------------------------------------|
| #244   | Realtime score calculation as schema is modified |
| #245   | Overall schema quality score (0-100)             |
| #246   | Historical score tracking with trend chart       |
| #247   | Score breakdown by category                      |

**Score Visualization** 📋 PLANNED
- 📋 Color-coded score indicator:
    - 📋 🟢 Green (90-100): Excellent - Production ready
    - 📋 🟡 Yellow (70-89): Good - Minor improvements needed
    - 📋 🟠 Orange (50-69): Fair - Significant improvements recommended
    - 📋 🔴 Red (0-49): Poor - Major issues must be addressed
- 📋 Animated score gauge with smooth transitions
- 📋 Score comparison across versions
- Team average score for benchmarking
- Export score reports as PDF

| Ticket | Feature Description                          |
|--------|----------------------------------------------|
| #248   | Add color-coded score indicators             |
| #249   | Add gauge for schemas                        |
| #250   | Add project version schema scoring breakdown |
| #251   | Add scoring comparison across versions       |
| #252   | Score report export as PDF                   |

**Validation Rules Engine**
- **Naming Convention Rules**:
    - Class names: PascalCase, singular nouns
    - Property names: camelCase, descriptive
    - No abbreviations without glossary entry
    - Consistent terminology across schema
    - Maximum name length constraints
- **Documentation Rules**:
    - Required description for all classes (min 20 characters)
    - Required description for all properties (min 10 characters)
    - At least one example per class
    - External documentation links for complex types
- **Schema Design Rules**:
    - No circular dependencies
    - Maximum nesting depth (default: 5 levels)
    - Avoid primitive obsession (use composed types)
    - Consistent use of composition (allOf) vs inheritance
    - Required fields should be necessary, not excessive
- **API Design Rules** (for Path spec):
    - RESTful URL patterns (`/resources/{id}`)
    - Proper HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE)
    - Consistent error response format
    - Pagination for list endpoints
    - Filtering, sorting query parameters
    - API versioning strategy (URL or header)
- **Security Rules**:
    - Authentication required for non-public endpoints
    - Sensitive data marked as `writeOnly`
    - No PII in URL parameters
    - Rate limiting configured
    - HTTPS only (no HTTP)
- **Performance Rules**:
    - Response size limits
    - Required cache headers
    - Compression support
    - Conditional requests (ETag, If-Modified-Since)

| Ticket | Feature Description                              |

## 📊 Schema Management Features (Schema Quality)

### Schema Intelligence

**Schema Metrics**

    - Based on documentation, consistency, size
- **Reusability Score**:
    - How reusable are the classes
    - Based on dependencies, coupling
- **Coverage**:
    - How much is documented
    - How many examples provided
    - How many tests
