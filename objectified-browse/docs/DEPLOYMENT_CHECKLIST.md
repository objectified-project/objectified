## Quick Test Script

Run this script to quickly verify basic functionality:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
BASE_URL="http://localhost:3000"

echo "Testing home page..."
curl -s -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}" $BASE_URL
echo ""

echo "Testing search..."
curl -s -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}" "$BASE_URL/search?q=test"
echo ""

echo "All basic tests passed! ✓"
```

## Rollback Plan

If deployment fails:

1. Revert to previous version
2. Check logs for errors
3. Verify database connectivity
4. Verify REST API connectivity
5. Test in development environment
6. Fix issues and redeploy
