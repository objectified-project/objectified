## Future Restoration

When GitHub and Community resources become available, uncomment the relevant sections in:

1. `/src/app/components/Footer.tsx` - Lines with `/* GitHub - Coming Soon */` and `/* Community - Coming Soon */`
2. `/src/app/page.tsx` - Line with `/* GitHub - Coming Soon */`
3. Add back the `Github` import in Footer.tsx: `import { Github, Twitter, Linkedin, Youtube } from 'lucide-react';`

---

## Notes

- All changes are properly commented with "Coming Soon" markers for easy restoration
- No functionality was broken - only non-existent links were removed
- The disabled community page (`src/app/community.disabled/`) still contains GitHub/Discord references but is not active
