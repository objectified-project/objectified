# How do I… lint & check quality?

Objectified computes a **server-side quality score** (an A–F grade out of 100) plus itemized lint
findings for a version. The score is computed on the server so the UI and the CLI always agree —
there is no client-side scoring to drift. Use it before cutting and publishing a version.

---

## In the UI

Open the **Designer** at `/ade/studio`; the quality grade and findings are shown for the version you
are editing. Fix the findings (most are missing descriptions) and the grade updates.

## With the CLI

```bash
objectified lint --project <id-or-slug> --version <id-or-label>

# gate on a minimum grade (exit non-zero if below)
objectified lint --project <id-or-slug> --version <id-or-label> --min-grade B

# compare against a base version to surface breaking changes
objectified lint --project <id-or-slug> --version <id-or-label> --base-version <id-or-label>
```

`--min-grade` (A–F) makes the command suitable for CI gates; `--base-version` adds breaking-change
findings relative to that base.

## With the REST API

```http
GET /v1/versions/{tenant_slug}/{project_id}/{version_record_id}/lint?baseRevisionId=<optional>
X-API-Key: <your-api-key>
```

Returns the numeric score, the letter grade, and a list of findings (e.g. undocumented classes,
breaking changes when `baseRevisionId` is supplied).

## Verify

The grade and findings returned by the CLI match what the UI shows for the same version — that
consistency is the point of server-side scoring.
