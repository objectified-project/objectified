# How do I… cut a version?

Cutting a version creates a new **revision** of a project. Classes are carried over from the base,
while paths are authored on the new revision (see [edit-paths.md](edit-paths.md)). A version is the
unit you later **publish** ([publish-a-version.md](publish-a-version.md)).

---

## In the UI

1. Open **Versions** at `/ade/dashboard/versions`.
2. Choose **Cut a version**, set the version number and a revision note.
3. The new revision becomes the working revision you edit.

## With the REST API

```http
POST /v1/versions/{tenant_slug}/{project_id}
X-API-Key: <your-api-key>

{ "version": "1.1.0", "description": "Add the orders endpoint", "notes": "…" }
```

Returns the newly created version record (unpublished).

## With the CLI

The CLI inspects versions (authoring/cutting happens in the UI/REST):

```bash
objectified versions list --project-id <id>
objectified versions get <version_id> --project-id <id>
```

## Verify

- **UI:** the new revision appears in the Versions list as unpublished.
- **CLI:** `objectified versions list --project-id <id>` shows it.
