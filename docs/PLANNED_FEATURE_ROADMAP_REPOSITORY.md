# Planned Feature Roadmap: Repository Connector

## Completed

- REPO-2.1 (#2762): Added a streaming repository tree walker that iterates files at a commit SHA, enforces typed scan limits (`SCAN_LIMIT_EXCEEDED`), applies subpath glob filtering at the walker boundary, and emits `repository.scan.walked` workflow audit events.
- REPO-1.8 (#2760): Implemented a Bitbucket Cloud repository provider adapter for REST API 2.0 with shared contract coverage, UUID-based webhook verification, and linked-account availability for Bitbucket linking.
- REPO-1.7 (#2759): Implemented the GitLab repository provider adapter with full contract coverage, keyset pagination for repository listing, and GitLab webhook registration/signature verification.
- REPO-1.4 (#2756): Added repository registration UI flow and REST registration endpoint for GitHub repositories.
- REPO-1.5 (#2757): Added per-repository branch management with per-branch subpath and polling settings, including default branch preselection and wildcard branch patterns.
- REPO-1.6 (#2758): Added repository settings edit/archive/unarchive/delete flows with typed delete confirmation, archival audit events, and deletion cascades for repository relations.
