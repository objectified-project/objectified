## Design alignment for objectified-commercial

These ticket drafts are designed to match the current product direction:

- UI uses `Next.js + TypeScript + Tailwind + Radix UI` with modern, compact workflows.
- Existing git-like patterns already exist in Objectified and are extended here for enterprise-grade controls.
- Behavior is centered on version-first workflows, not file-based Git primitives.
- Multi-tenant compliance, auditability, and safe collaboration are first-class requirements.

## Prioritized single-scope tickets for objectified-commercial

Each ticket below is intentionally small enough to complete in isolation. They are ordered by delivery priority and dependency.

## P0-01: Add Commit Metadata Fields to Revision Records

### Problem statement
Commits are not consistently traceable to who made the change or why. Teams need author/message/reference metadata to audit change intent and link commits to delivery workflows.

### Scope
Add metadata persistence for commit author, message, and external reference id. Return these fields in revision history APIs.

### Acceptance criteria
- Commit API accepts and stores `author`, `message`, and `externalRef`.
- Revision history returns these fields for each commit.
- Existing commits without metadata still render without errors.

---

## P0-02: Commit Dialog with Radix Form Validation

### Problem statement
Users can commit without a structured UI flow, leading to inconsistent commit quality and missing metadata.

### Scope
Add a Radix dialog for commit action with message, optional external reference, and inline validation.

### Acceptance criteria
- Commit action opens a Radix dialog with fields and clear labels.
- Submit is disabled until required fields pass validation.
- Success and error states are shown with project-standard toasts.

---

## P0-03: Add Pre-Commit Policy Enforcement (Message Required + Max Payload)

### Problem statement
Without policy enforcement, commits can violate tenant standards (empty messages, oversized payloads).

### Scope
Implement policy checks before commit and return policy violations in a consistent error format.

### Acceptance criteria
- Policy rejects empty message when enabled.
- Policy rejects payload above configured size threshold.
- API returns deterministic error codes and human-readable messages.

---

## P0-04: Add Push Base Revision Check (Optimistic Locking)

### Problem statement
Concurrent edits can overwrite each other because push does not always require a base revision match.

### Scope
Require `baseRevisionId` on push and return `409` conflict when stale.

### Acceptance criteria
- Push without `baseRevisionId` is rejected.
- Push with stale base revision returns `409` and latest server revision metadata.
- Valid push with current base revision succeeds.

---

## P0-05: Push Conflict Banner + CTA Guidance in Studio

### Problem statement
Users receiving push conflicts do not get a clear next action path.

### Scope
Add server-ahead conflict banner with direct CTAs (`Pull`, `Open Merge`) in editor toolbar/state region.

### Acceptance criteria
- On `409`, UI shows persistent server-ahead banner.
- Banner includes direct actions for pull/merge.
- Banner clears automatically after successful reconciliation.

---

## P0-06: Add Pull Conditional Fetch (ETag / 304)

### Problem statement

### Scope
Support `If-None-Match` on pull and return `304` when version head is unchanged.

### Acceptance criteria
- Pull returns ETag header.
- Pull with matching ETag returns `304` with empty body.
- Pull with stale ETag returns fresh state payload.

---

## P0-07: Show Sync State Indicators (Dirty, Unpushed, Server Ahead)

### Problem statement
Editors lack clear status visibility, causing accidental pushes/pulls at the wrong time.

### Scope
Add compact sync indicators in toolbar/header using modern status chips.

### Acceptance criteria
- Dirty state indicator updates on local edits.
- Unpushed commit count is shown when greater than zero.
- Server-ahead state appears when remote head differs from local base.

---

### Acceptance criteria
- Endpoint accepts source revision and target branch name.
- New version branch is created with source lineage.
- Duplicate branch names in same project are rejected with clear error.

---

## P0-09: Branch Creation Dialog from History Row

### Problem statement

### Acceptance criteria
- History row exposes `Branch from here` action.
- Dialog prefills suggested branch name and allows edits.
- On success, user is navigated to the new branch version.

---

## P0-10: Merge Preview Endpoint (No State Mutation)
