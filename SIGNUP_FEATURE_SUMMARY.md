# Signup Feature Implementation Summary

## Overview
This document describes the implementation of the signup feature for the Objectified application. Users can now create account signup requests from the Login page.

## Date
November 19, 2025

## Changes Made

### 1. Database Helper Function (`lib/db/helper.ts`)

Added a new function `createSignupRequest` that:
- Accepts name, email, password, and signup source (where user heard about Objectified)
- Checks for duplicate email addresses in the signup table
- Hashes the password using bcrypt before storing
- Inserts the signup request into `odb.signup` table
- Returns appropriate success/error/duplicate messages

```typescript
export async function createSignupRequest(name: string, email: string, password: string, signupSource: string)
```

**Key Features:**
- Duplicate email detection with friendly message
- Password hashing for security (10 salt rounds)
- Error handling with descriptive messages
- Server-side only (no REST exposure)

### 2. Login Client UI (`src/app/login/LoginClient.tsx`)

Updated the login page to include signup functionality:

#### New Features Added:
1. **Full Name Field** - Required text input for user's full name (shown only in signup mode)
2. **Where did you hear about Objectified?** - Optional text input to track signup sources
3. **Success/Error Message Display** - Visual feedback for signup actions
4. **Form State Management** - Proper handling of signup vs. login modes

#### User Experience Flow:
1. User clicks "Sign Up" toggle button
2. Form displays additional fields:
   - Full Name (required)
   - Email (required)
   - Password (required)
   - Where did you hear about Objectified? (optional)
3. User submits the form
4. System checks for duplicate email:
   - **If duplicate**: Shows blue info message: "You have already requested account access, thank you for your continued interest!"
   - **If successful**: Shows green success message: "Your signup was accepted, and you will be contacted by a member of the Objectified staff shortly." Form is cleared.
   - **If error**: Shows red error message with details

#### Visual Design:
- Uses Lucide React icons (Mail, Lock, User, Info)
- Color-coded message boxes:
  - Green (success): `bg-green-50 border-green-200 text-green-800`
  - Blue (info/duplicate): `bg-blue-50 border-blue-200 text-blue-800`
  - Red (error): `bg-red-50 border-red-200 text-red-800`
- Consistent styling with existing login form
- Messages clear when switching between login/signup modes

### 3. Database Schema (Already Exists)

The `odb.signup` table structure:
```sql
CREATE TABLE signup (
    name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    email_address VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    password VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    signup_source VARCHAR(255),
    signup_date TIMESTAMP WITHOUT TIME ZONE DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
```

Indexes:
- `idx_signup_email_address` - For efficient email lookups
- `idx_signup_signup_source` - For analytics on signup sources
- `idx_signup_email_unique` - Enforces unique email constraint

## Security Considerations

1. **Password Hashing**: All passwords are hashed using bcrypt with 10 salt rounds before storage
2. **Server-side Processing**: All signup logic runs server-side (marked with 'use server')
3. **No REST Exposure**: Intentionally not exposed via REST API to maintain security
4. **Input Validation**: Form validation ensures required fields are filled

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Test Successful Signup**:
   - Fill in all fields with valid data
   - Verify success message appears
   - Verify form clears after successful signup
   - Check database for new record

2. **Test Duplicate Email**:
   - Sign up with an email
   - Try signing up again with the same email
   - Verify info message appears about already requesting access

3. **Test Form Validation**:
   - Try submitting with empty required fields
   - Verify browser validation works

4. **Test Mode Switching**:
   - Switch between Sign In and Sign Up modes
   - Verify messages clear when switching
   - Verify correct fields are shown/hidden

5. **Test Optional Field**:
   - Submit form with and without "signup_source" field
   - Verify both work correctly

## Future Enhancements

Consider adding:
1. Admin interface to review and approve signup requests
2. Email notification when signup request is received
3. Password strength indicator
4. Email verification before account creation
5. CAPTCHA to prevent automated signups
6. Rate limiting to prevent abuse

## Files Modified

1. `/objectified-ui/lib/db/helper.ts` - Added `createSignupRequest` function
2. `/objectified-ui/src/app/login/LoginClient.tsx` - Added signup UI and logic

## No Changes Required

- No REST API endpoints added (as requested)
- No database schema changes needed (table already exists)
- No authentication/authorization changes needed
