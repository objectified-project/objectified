/**
 * `backup dump` — daily plain-SQL dumps with day-over-day diffs.
 *
 * Each run takes a `pg_dump --format=plain` of the database and writes a dated file:
 *
 *   - `backup-YYYY-MM-DD.sql`        a FULL plain-SQL dump.
 *   - `backup-YYYY-MM-DD.sql.patch`  a unified DIFF from the most recent prior day's backup.
 *
 * The first backup (or any run forced with `--full`) is a full dump. When a prior-day backup
 * already exists, today's run instead stores only the unified diff from that prior state to the new
 * dump — the standard incremental scheme that keeps day-to-day storage small. Restoring a given day
 * means starting from the most recent full and applying each patch in date order (see README); the
 * patches are ordinary `diff -u` output, so the system `patch` tool restores them.
 *
 * To diff against the prior day we must reconstruct that day's full SQL. Reconstruction walks back
 * to the latest full on/before the prior day and replays the intervening patches — the same chain a
 * restore follows. The pg_dump / diff / patch steps are injected as `BackupDumpDeps` so the
 * orchestration is unit-tested without shelling out, while the real deps wrap pg_dump and GNU
 * diff/patch.
