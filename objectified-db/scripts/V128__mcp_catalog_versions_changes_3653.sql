-- External MCP Catalog (#3653, V2-MCP-15.3 / MCAT-1.3): version snapshots + change records.
--
-- Discovery is periodic (MCAT-7.x): every time the pipeline re-handshakes an endpoint and finds a
-- materially different surface, that result is frozen as one immutable snapshot here. This is the
-- table V126 (`mcp_endpoints.current_version_id`) and V127 (`mcp_capability_items.version_id`) were
-- both written to point at but could not yet reference — Flyway applies migrations in version order,
-- so neither could add a FK to a table that did not exist. V128 creates that table and, now that it
-- exists, retro-fits both deferred foreign keys (see the FK-ordering notes in V126/V127 headers).
--
-- `mcp_endpoint_versions` is the snapshot: the server's identity at discovery time (protocol,
-- name/title/version, instructions), its declared `capabilities` blob, and a `surface_fingerprint`
-- (a stable hash of the discovered surface) used to decide whether a new discovery actually changed
-- anything — and thus whether a new version row is warranted at all. The per-item normalized rows of
-- that surface live in `mcp_capability_items` (V127), children of this snapshot via `version_id`.
--
-- `mcp_version_changes` is the recorded diff: one row per item added / removed / modified relative to
-- the previous version, linked to the version that introduced the change. `detail` carries the
-- before/after payload (a removal has only `before`, an addition only `after`, a modification both).
--
-- Immutability (acceptance criterion). A snapshot — and its change records — are write-once: once a
-- discovery result is recorded it must never be edited. A re-discovery produces a *new* version with
-- a fresh fingerprint, never a mutation of an existing one (this is also why neither table carries an
-- `updated_at`). We enforce this at the database level with a BEFORE UPDATE trigger that raises, so
-- the rule holds regardless of which code path writes. DELETE is intentionally *not* blocked: the FK
-- chain from tenants -> mcp_endpoints is ON DELETE CASCADE, and a tenant/endpoint teardown must be
-- able to reap its versions; immutability concerns a row's *contents*, not the right to drop it
-- wholesale when its owner goes away.
--
-- Monotonic `version_seq` (acceptance criterion). `version_seq` is a per-endpoint counter assigned by
-- the discovery pipeline; `UNIQUE(endpoint_id, version_seq)` guarantees two snapshots of one endpoint
-- can never collide on a sequence number, and the `>= 1` check keeps it a positive ordinal. Strict
-- "next = max + 1" allocation is the application's responsibility (mirroring canvas_layout_revisions,
-- V066); the unique constraint is the backstop that makes a buggy double-assignment fail loudly.
--
-- Rollback notes: this migration adds two tables, their indexes, an immutability trigger function +
-- two triggers, and two foreign-key constraints on pre-existing tables. To roll back:
--   ALTER TABLE odb.mcp_capability_items DROP CONSTRAINT IF EXISTS mcp_capability_items_version_fk;
--   ALTER TABLE odb.mcp_endpoints       DROP CONSTRAINT IF EXISTS mcp_endpoints_current_version_fk;
--   DROP TABLE IF EXISTS odb.mcp_version_changes CASCADE;
--   DROP TABLE IF EXISTS odb.mcp_endpoint_versions CASCADE;
--   DROP FUNCTION IF EXISTS odb.mcp_forbid_row_mutation();
-- (Dropping the constraints first leaves V126/V127's columns as the plain UUIDs they were before.)
