-- Convert-to-project/version provenance (#4006, MFI-22.5).
--
-- MFI-EPIC-22 turns a *catalog item* — an OpenAPI-worthy non-OpenAPI import (gRPC, GraphQL,
-- AsyncAPI, OData, …) that landed as a non-publishable catalog project (V138, MFI-23.1) — into a
-- real, editable **publishable OpenAPI Project**. The conversion job (MFI-22.5) emits an OpenAPI 3.1
-- document from the source's canonical model (MFI-22.1/22.2), mints a new Project + `v1` from it
-- (reusing the spec-import engine), runs the OpenAPI lint/score (MFI-EPIC-4) on the result, and must
-- record **where the converted spec came from** so:
--
--   * the converted Project links back to its origin (which catalog item + which source revision,
--     in which source format/protocol);
--   * a later **re-convert** of a changed source produces a *new version* of the same converted
--     Project instead of a duplicate Project (looked up by source artifact); and
--   * a later re-import diffs cleanly and the conversion is reproducible (the fidelity report and the
--     converter tool versions that produced it are captured alongside).
--
-- This migration adds the `odb.conversion_provenance` audit table that holds exactly that lineage.
-- It is an **append-only** record: one row per conversion (initial convert or re-convert), never
-- updated — enforced write-once by a trigger, mirroring the immutable-audit pattern established for
-- the MCP catalog version rows (V128).
--
-- Rollback notes: purely additive. To roll back:
--   DROP TRIGGER IF EXISTS trigger_conversion_provenance_immutable ON odb.conversion_provenance;
--   DROP FUNCTION IF EXISTS odb.conversion_provenance_forbid_mutation();
--   DROP TABLE IF EXISTS odb.conversion_provenance;
