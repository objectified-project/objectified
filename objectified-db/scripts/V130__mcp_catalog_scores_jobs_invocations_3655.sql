-- External MCP Catalog (#3655, V2-MCP-15.5 / MCAT-1.5): scores, discovery jobs, and test invocations.
--
-- With the catalog (V126), capability items (V127), version snapshots (V128), and the credential
-- vault (V129) in place, this migration adds the last three persistence surfaces the catalog needs:
--
--   * mcp_version_scores    — a quality/lint score per discovery snapshot. Mirrors the shape of the
--                             per-revision `versions.quality_*` columns from V124 (a 0-100 `score`, an
--                             A-F `grade`, and a `report_fingerprint` for staleness detection), but as
--                             its own table keyed to `mcp_endpoint_versions`. One score per version
--                             (UNIQUE) — re-scoring a version upserts the row, so `scored_at` moves.
--   * mcp_discovery_jobs    — the async discovery-pipeline work log (MCAT-7.x). Each row is one job:
--                             its lifecycle `state` (queued -> running -> completed|failed), what
--                             `trigger`ed it (manual|sweep|registry), its start/finish times, and the
--                             `error`/`result` of the run. Mutable: the pipeline advances `state` and
--                             stamps `started_at`/`finished_at` as the job progresses.
--   * mcp_test_invocations  — the test-console call log (MCAT-9.x). Each row records one invocation of
--                             a capability item (a tool call, resource read, prompt get): the
--                             `arguments` sent, the `response` received, whether it was an error, and
--                             the round-trip `latency_ms`. An append-only audit of "what was tried".
--
-- FK cascades on endpoint delete (acceptance criterion). `mcp_discovery_jobs` and
-- `mcp_test_invocations` reference `mcp_endpoints(id) ON DELETE CASCADE` directly, so they are reaped
-- when their endpoint (or its tenant) is hard-deleted. `mcp_version_scores` keys to
-- `mcp_endpoint_versions(id) ON DELETE CASCADE`, which itself cascades from the endpoint (V128) — so
-- scores are reaped transitively on endpoint teardown too. `version_id` on `mcp_test_invocations` is
-- nullable and ON DELETE SET NULL: a single version snapshot can be pruned without losing the test
-- log (the endpoint_id cascade still reaps everything on full endpoint teardown). `invoked_by`
-- likewise SET NULLs so the audit survives a user being removed.
--
-- Indexes (acceptance criterion): `(endpoint_id, created_at)` for the discovery-job and test-invocation
-- logs (list an endpoint's most recent activity), and `(state)` for the discovery scheduler picking up
-- queued jobs.
--
-- Rollback notes: this migration is purely additive (three new tables, their indexes, and comments).
-- To roll back:
--   DROP TABLE IF EXISTS odb.mcp_test_invocations CASCADE;
--   DROP TABLE IF EXISTS odb.mcp_discovery_jobs   CASCADE;
--   DROP TABLE IF EXISTS odb.mcp_version_scores   CASCADE;
-- (Each DROP also removes that table's dependent indexes.)
