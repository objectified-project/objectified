-- External MCP Catalog (#3671, V2-MCP-18.4 / MCAT-4.4): date/time version tagging.
--
-- Version history must be navigable by a tagged date/time (an explicit user requirement). V128 gave
-- every snapshot a monotonic `version_seq` and a `discovered_at` timestamp, but neither is the
-- *human-readable, addressable* tag the requirement asks for. This migration adds `version_tag` to
-- `mcp_endpoint_versions`: a compact UTC date/time label (e.g. `2026-06-26T14:03Z`) that the
-- discovery pipeline stamps on each new snapshot and that history listings (MCAT-4.5) surface.
--
-- Uniqueness (acceptance criterion). A tag must address exactly one version *within an endpoint*, so
-- the constraint is `UNIQUE(endpoint_id, version_tag)` — two different endpoints discovered in the
-- same minute legitimately share the label, but one endpoint never reuses it. Minute-precision labels
-- mean two material surface changes to the same endpoint inside one minute would collide; the
-- application disambiguates by appending `-2`, `-3`, … to the base label (mirroring how it allocates
-- `version_seq`), and this unique constraint is the backstop that makes any double-assignment fail
-- loudly rather than silently aliasing two versions to one tag.
--
-- Immutability (acceptance criterion). The tag inherits the table's existing write-once guarantee:
-- the BEFORE UPDATE trigger installed in V128 (`mcp_forbid_row_mutation`) already rejects any in-place
-- edit of a snapshot row, so once stamped a tag can never change. The only place that rule must yield
-- is this migration's own one-time backfill of pre-existing rows, for which the trigger is briefly
-- disabled and then restored (see below).
--
-- Backfill. Existing snapshots predate the column, so `version_tag` is added NULLable first,
-- back-filled from each row's `discovered_at` (falling back to `created_at` when discovery time was
-- not recorded), then made NOT NULL. Within an endpoint, rows whose labels would collide are ordered
-- by `version_seq` and the 2nd, 3rd, … get a `-N` suffix — identical to the runtime disambiguation —
-- so the backfill can never violate the unique constraint it is about to add. The immutability trigger
-- is disabled for the duration of the UPDATE and re-enabled immediately after.
--
-- Rollback notes:
--   ALTER TABLE odb.mcp_endpoint_versions DROP CONSTRAINT IF EXISTS mcp_endpoint_versions_endpoint_tag_unique;
--   ALTER TABLE odb.mcp_endpoint_versions DROP COLUMN IF EXISTS version_tag;

SET search_path TO odb, public;

-- 1. Add the column NULLable so existing rows can be back-filled before the NOT NULL is enforced.
ALTER TABLE mcp_endpoint_versions
    ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS version_tag TEXT;

-- 2. Back-fill existing snapshots. The immutability trigger (V128) rejects UPDATEs, so disable it for
--    this one-time data migration and restore it immediately afterwards.
