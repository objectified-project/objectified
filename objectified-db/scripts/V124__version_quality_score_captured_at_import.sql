-- Persisted quality / lint score per schema revision, captured at import time (#3609 follow-up).
--
-- The deterministic quality-scoring service (app.schema_lint, #3609) computes a 0-100 score and an
-- A-F grade for the OpenAPI reconstructed from a revision. That score was only ever computed
-- on-demand (GET .../lint), so a project imported via the CLI / REST worker showed no score in the
-- projects list. These columns let the import capture the score onto the new revision so the
-- projects list can surface it for every import source (not just browser-local snapshots).
--
-- Nullable: pre-existing revisions and revisions created by non-import flows have no captured score
-- until they are (re)linted.
