"""Unit tests for ``document_bytes_from_spec`` serialization.

The import worker parses uploaded documents with a strict JS YAML reader, and re-serializing a parsed
spec back to YAML can emit constructs that reader rejects (e.g. a description line beginning
``- **field**:`` becomes an ambiguous block sequence), even when the original parsed cleanly. So the
CLI always uploads JSON regardless of the source filename — JSON is unambiguous and is itself valid
YAML.
