"""Render catalog → OpenAPI conversion results for the ``convert`` command (MFI-22.6).

Pure, stream-agnostic formatting helpers (no HTTP, no ``typer``) so the fidelity summary + warning
the ``convert`` command prints are unit-testable in isolation. The authoritative fidelity report is
computed server-side by objectified-rest (MFI-22.3); this module only *presents* the report the API
returns — it never recomputes a score, a grade, or a tier.

Two response shapes are rendered, both carrying the same ``report``:

* a **dry-run** (``convert --dry-run``) returns ``{report, openapi, sourceFormat, target}`` — the
  fidelity report and the would-be OpenAPI document, with no Project created;
* a **commit** returns ``{projectId, versionId, report, ...}`` — the created Project/version ids.

The mandatory warning sentence mirrors the preview screen (MFI-22.4) so every surface says the same
thing, and the ``low`` fidelity tier is what the command turns into its non-zero exit hint.
