## Suggested Enterprise Improvements

> The following features were identified by reviewing the current canvas implementation against enterprise user expectations. They are organized by priority.

### 11. Undo/Redo System 📋 PLANNED

[TODO] The canvas currently has **no undo/redo** capability. This is the single most critical missing feature for enterprise use, as any accidental class deletion, edge removal, node move, or property edit is irreversible without reloading.

- [TODO] **Undo stack** with configurable depth (default 50, max 500 operations)
- [TODO] **Tracked operations**: class create/delete/rename/move, property add/edit/delete, edge create/delete, group operations, layout changes
- [TODO] **Keyboard shortcuts**: `Cmd/Ctrl + Z` (Undo), `Cmd/Ctrl + Shift + Z` (Redo)
- [TODO] **History panel** (`Cmd/Ctrl + H`): Visual timeline of all changes with the ability to jump to any point
- [TODO] **Operation coalescing**: Rapid sequential moves of the same node are collapsed into a single undo entry
- [TODO] **Persistent undo across sessions**: Optionally persist undo stack to database so changes survive page reload

---

### 12. Command Palette 📋 PLANNED

[TODO] A quick-access command palette (like VS Code `Cmd+K`) to search and execute any canvas action by name, improving discoverability and keyboard-driven workflows.

- [TODO] **Trigger**: `Cmd/Ctrl + K` opens an overlay search box
- [TODO] **Action index**: All canvas actions searchable by name (e.g., "Save Layout", "Export as PNG", "Auto-organize", "Toggle Grid", "Create Group", "Zoom to Fit")
- [TODO] **Fuzzy matching**: Matches partial and out-of-order terms
- [TODO] **Recent actions**: Show recently used commands at the top
- [TODO] **Contextual commands**: Show different commands based on what is selected (e.g., when a node is selected, show "Delete Class", "Edit Properties", "Change Color")
- [TODO] **Keyboard navigation**: Arrow keys to move, Enter to execute, Esc to dismiss

---

### 13. Copy/Paste & Duplicate Nodes 📋 PLANNED

[TODO] Enterprise users expect standard clipboard operations on the canvas.

- [TODO] **Copy** (`Cmd/Ctrl + C`): Copy selected class nodes to an internal clipboard (including properties and schema)
- [TODO] **Paste** (`Cmd/Ctrl + V`): Paste copied nodes onto the canvas at the cursor position with de-duplicated names (e.g., "User" becomes "User (Copy)")
- [TODO] **Duplicate** (`Cmd/Ctrl + D`): In-place duplicate of selected nodes offset by a small amount
- [TODO] **Cross-version paste**: Copy a class from one version and paste into another
- [TODO] **Multi-select copy**: Copy multiple classes with their inter-relationships preserved

---

### 14. Canvas Annotations & Comments 📋 PLANNED

[TODO] No annotation or comment system exists on the canvas. Enterprise design reviews and architecture discussions require the ability to leave comments on the schema.

- [TODO] **Sticky notes**: Freeform text notes placeable anywhere on the canvas (distinct from class nodes)
- [TODO] **Pin comments to nodes**: Attach a comment bubble to a specific class or property
- [TODO] **Comment threads**: Reply to comments, mark as resolved
- [TODO] **@Mentions**: Tag team members in comments to notify them
- [TODO] **Rich text**: Markdown support in comments with code snippets
- [TODO] **Comment visibility toggle**: Show/hide all annotations without deleting them
- [TODO] **Comment export**: Include or exclude annotations when exporting canvas images

---

### 15. Canvas Bookmarks & Waypoints 📋 PLANNED

[TODO] Large schemas (50+ classes) require spatial navigation aids beyond the minimap.

- [TODO] **Bookmarks** (`Cmd/Ctrl + 1-9`): Save up to 9 named viewport positions (x, y, zoom) per version
- [TODO] **Bookmark panel**: List all bookmarks with thumbnail previews
- [TODO] **Jump to bookmark**: Smooth animated pan/zoom to bookmarked position
- [TODO] **Bookmark sharing**: Bookmarks saved per-user but shareable as deep links
- [TODO] **Auto-bookmarks**: Auto-create bookmarks for each group centroid

---

### 16. Real-Time Collaboration 📋 PLANNED

[TODO] The canvas has no multi-user collaboration support. For enterprise teams, concurrent editing is expected.

- [TODO] **Presence indicators**: Show avatar badges of users currently viewing the canvas
- [TODO] **Live cursors**: Display other users' cursor positions on the canvas in real time
- [TODO] **Operational Transform or CRDT**: Conflict-free concurrent edits to nodes, edges, and properties
- [TODO] **Change attribution**: Show who last modified each class (tooltip or badge)
- [TODO] **Conflict resolution UI**: When two users edit the same class simultaneously, present a merge dialog
- [TODO] **Activity feed**: Sidebar showing a live stream of canvas changes by all users
- [TODO] **Follow mode**: Click a user's avatar to lock your viewport to their position

---

### 17. Canvas Audit Trail 📋 PLANNED

[TODO] Enterprise compliance requires knowing who changed what and when on the canvas.

- [TODO] **Change log per class**: Every create, update, delete, move recorded with timestamp + user
- [TODO] **Change log per version**: Aggregated changelog across all classes in a version
- [TODO] **Canvas diff playback**: Step through the change history chronologically to see the canvas evolve
- [TODO] **Blame view**: Color-code nodes by last editor (who touched it most recently)
- [TODO] **Export audit trail**: CSV/JSON export of all changes for compliance reporting
- [TODO] **Retention policy**: Configurable how long audit entries are kept

---

### 18. Improved Editor Page Architecture 📋 PLANNED

[TODO] The main editor page (`page.tsx`) is approximately 5,100 lines. This hurts maintainability, code review velocity, and bundle splitting.

- [TODO] **Extract custom hooks**: Move canvas interaction handlers into dedicated hooks (`useCanvasInteractions`, `useCanvasSearch`, `useCanvasGroups`, `useCanvasLayout`, `useCanvasKeyboard`)
- [TODO] **Extract sub-components**: Break the render into smaller components (`CanvasToolbar`, `CanvasSearchPanel`, `CanvasSettingsSheet`, `CanvasStatusBar`)
- [TODO] **Lazy-load dialogs**: Code-split heavy dialogs (export wizard, settings, class edit) so they do not bloat the initial canvas bundle
- [TODO] **Reduce re-renders**: Audit `useEffect` dependency arrays and memoize expensive computations (the file has numerous large dependency arrays that likely trigger unnecessary re-renders)
- [TODO] **Performance profiling**: Add React DevTools Profiler markers for layout calculations, node rendering, and search filtering to identify bottlenecks on large canvases

---

### 19. Canvas-Level Validation & Linting 📋 PLANNED

[TODO] Provide real-time feedback on schema design quality directly on the canvas, beyond the existing quality score.

- [TODO] **Dangling reference warnings**: Highlight properties that reference non-existent classes with a red badge on the edge
- [TODO] **Circular dependency detection**: When a circular reference is created, show a warning toast and highlight the cycle on the canvas
- [TODO] **Naming convention lint**: Warn when class or property names violate configurable naming rules (e.g., PascalCase for classes, camelCase for properties)
- [TODO] **Unused class detection**: Dim or badge classes that are not referenced by any other class
- [TODO] **Required property audit**: Badge classes where required properties have no description or no type
- [TODO] **Schema complexity warnings**: Warn when a single class exceeds a configurable property count threshold (e.g., 30+ properties suggests the class should be decomposed)
- [TODO] **Lint panel**: A toggleable sidebar listing all lint warnings with click-to-navigate

---

### 20. Canvas Accessibility 📋 PLANNED

[TODO] Enterprise products are expected to meet WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility standards.

- [TODO] **Keyboard-only navigation**: Tab/Shift+Tab to cycle through nodes, arrow keys to move selected node, Enter to open edit dialog
- [TODO] **Screen reader announcements**: ARIA live regions for canvas state changes (node created, deleted, moved)
- [TODO] **High-contrast edge colors**: Ensure all edge colors meet 4.5:1 contrast ratio in both light and dark modes
- [TODO] **Focus ring indicators**: Visible focus outlines on selected nodes and edges for keyboard users
- [TODO] **Reduced motion mode**: Respect `prefers-reduced-motion` OS setting; disable edge animations and LOD transitions
- [TODO] **Zoom with keyboard**: `+` / `-` keys to zoom in/out, `0` to reset zoom

---

### 21. Canvas Import from External Tools 📋 PLANNED

[TODO] Enterprise teams migrate from existing diagramming tools. Support importing canvas layouts from common formats.

- [TODO] **Import from Draw.io / diagrams.net**: Parse `.drawio` XML and create classes + relationships on canvas
- [TODO] **Import from Lucidchart**: Parse exported JSON/CSV and map to canvas nodes
- [TODO] **Import from Mermaid**: Parse Mermaid class diagram syntax and create corresponding schema
- [TODO] **Import from PlantUML**: Parse PlantUML class diagram and create corresponding schema
- [TODO] **Import from ERD tools** (dbdiagram.io, pgModeler): Parse SQL DDL or DBML and map to classes

---

### 22. Canvas Minimap Enhancements 📋 PLANNED

[TODO] The minimap is functional but could be improved for large schemas.

- [TODO] **Group highlighting in minimap**: Color-code minimap regions by group
- [TODO] **Minimap node badges**: Show tiny color indicators for validation warnings
- [TODO] **Minimap click-to-zoom**: Click a region in the minimap to zoom into that area (currently pans only)
- [TODO] **Minimap resizable**: Allow users to resize the minimap or dock it to a sidebar
- [TODO] **Minimap toggle shortcut**: `M` key to show/hide minimap

---

### 23. Version Comparison on Canvas 📋 PLANNED

[TODO] Version comparison currently works as a side-by-side code diff. Enterprise users need a visual diff directly on the canvas.

- [TODO] **Canvas overlay diff**: Overlay two versions on the same canvas with added nodes in green, removed in red, modified in yellow
- [TODO] **Side-by-side canvas diff**: Two linked canvases (left = old version, right = new) that pan/zoom together
- [TODO] **Diff badges on nodes**: Per-class badge showing "Added", "Modified", "Removed"
- [TODO] **Property-level diff**: Expand a modified class to see which properties changed (inline green/red/yellow)
- [TODO] **Diff navigation**: "Next change" / "Previous change" buttons to jump between differences
- [TODO] **Cherry-pick merge**: Select individual changes from a diff to apply to the current version
