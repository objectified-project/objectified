### 3. Node Grouping & Organization

#### Group Containers 📋 PARTIALLY IMPLEMENTED
- ✅ Create visual containers to group related classes together
- ✅ Color-coded groups with custom names (e.g., "Authentication Models", "Payment Services")
- ✅ Drag and drop classes into groups to join them
- ✅ Visual highlight when dragging nodes over a group (green ring)
- ✅ Confirmation dialog when removing a class from a group (only when completely outside group bounds)
- ✅ Cancel ungroup snaps node back inside the group bounds
- ✅ Moving a group moves all contained classes together
- ✅ Nodes stay within group when partially overlapping - only ungroup when completely outside
- ✅ Grouped nodes are locked to group bounds during dragging - cannot escape unless dragged completely outside
- ✅ Collapsible groups to reduce canvas clutter (#154)
  - ✅ Click chevron to collapse: compact frame with title and class count
  - ✅ Alt+Shift+[ / Alt+Shift+] — collapse all / expand all groups
  - ✅ Collapsed state persisted per user per version (localStorage)
- ✅ Nested groups for hierarchical organization (max 3 levels) (#155):
  - ✅ Parent groups can contain child group frames; drag a group into another to nest, or out to the canvas to unnest
  - ✅ Breadcrumb (Canvas → …) when drilling into nested groups; tree icon on the group header enters nested view
  - ✅ `parent_group_id` on `odb.groups`; sync and load preserve hierarchy
- ✅ Group-level operations (#156):
  - ✅ Move entire group with one drag
  - ✅ Delete all classes in a group
  - ✅ Export group as OpenAPI JSON/YAML (includes transitive `components.schemas` refs)
  - ✅ Duplicate group (copies classes, rewrites refs within the group, new group frame)
  - ✅ Bulk edits: description prefix/suffix, assign tag, set/clear read-only on top-level properties
- ✅ Named groups with descriptions and metadata
- ✅ Visual styling options:
  - ✅ Rounded rectangle containers with subtle shadows
  - ✅ Dashed or solid borders with custom colors
  - ✅ Background color/opacity customization
  - ✅ Optional group icons from icon library
- ✅ Group object is drag-and-drop to the canvas
