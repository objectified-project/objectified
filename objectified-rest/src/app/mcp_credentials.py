"""Load an MCP endpoint's auth headers for a discovery run (Epic-6 seam).

A discovery/test run against a protected MCP server must authenticate to it (V2-MCP-17.2, #3664).
Credentials live in ``odb.mcp_endpoint_credentials`` (V129) as **ciphertext** keyed by
``auth_type``; this module turns a stored credential into the HTTP headers the
:class:`app.mcp_client.transport_http.StreamableHttpTransport` attaches to every request.

The work splits across two tickets that meet here:

* **MCAT-6.1 (#3677)** — the *auth-type model*: how a **decrypted** payload becomes headers for
  ``none``/``bearer``/``header`` (and ``oauth2``/``env``). That mapping lives in
  :mod:`app.mcp_auth`; this module wires it to the credential store and to discovery.
* **MCAT-6.2 (#3678)** — *encryption-at-rest*: sealing/unsealing ``encrypted_payload`` with an
  app-managed key. :func:`decrypt_credential_payload` is the single seam that unseals a stored
  row's ciphertext in-memory at connect time, delegating to
  :func:`app.mcp_credential_crypto.unseal_credential_payload`. When no plaintext can be produced
  (encryption unconfigured, the row's key removed, or a tampered blob) it returns ``None``, so a
  sealed credential yields no headers and discovery proceeds unauthenticated — surfacing the
  server's ``AUTH_REQUIRED`` response through the normal error taxonomy rather than guessing at a
  secret it cannot read.

The ``none`` auth type (or no credential row at all) is fully supported today: it yields no auth
headers, which is exactly right for public/anonymous MCP servers.

    A row with no ciphertext, or one that cannot be decrypted (encryption unconfigured, the sealing
