"""Paradigm projection strategies: non-REST paradigm → OpenAPI paths — MFI-22.2 (#4003).

OpenAPI is a REST vocabulary: it describes *paths*, *HTTP verbs*, and *status-coded
responses*. A :class:`~app.canonical_model.CanonicalApi` that came from a REST source
maps onto that vocabulary one-to-one, but a model from any *other* paradigm does not
— an RPC method, a GraphQL field, an event channel, or a bare data schema has no
native path/verb/response. Each therefore needs an **explicit, documented
projection** that emits what it can and **declares what it loses**.

This module is that pluggable projection layer. A :class:`ProjectionStrategy` is
selected by :func:`get_projection` from the model's
:class:`~app.canonical_model.ApiParadigm`, and the reference
:class:`app.openapi_emitter.OpenApiEmitter` consults it — once per operation — to
resolve an operation's ``(method, path)`` binding (or to decide the operation has *no*
OpenAPI representation) and to gather any ``x-`` specification extensions and
document-level notes. Every strategy records its losses on a
:class:`~app.emitter.LossTracker` so the fidelity analyzer (MFI-22.3) can show what
each projection dropped or inferred, rather than silently discarding it.

The strategies, one per paradigm:

* **REST** (:class:`RestProjection`) — the identity projection: an operation's own
  ``http_method``/``http_path`` is used verbatim; an operation missing one gets a
  best-effort ``POST`` to a path derived from its key.
* **RPC** (:class:`RpcProjection`, gRPC/Smithy/Thrift/OpenRPC) — an ``http`` binding
  in ``extras`` (``google.api.http`` / Smithy ``http``) is honored when present; else
  a ``POST /{Service}/{Method}`` is synthesized (the gRPC-transcoding/JSON
  convention), with the input message as ``requestBody`` and the output as the
  ``200`` body. Streaming has no OpenAPI representation, so it is flagged as an
  ``x-`` extension plus a loss note.
* **Graph** (:class:`GraphProjection`, GraphQL) — a SOFA-style projection: queries →
  ``GET`` and mutations → ``POST`` under a root path, arguments → parameters;
  **subscriptions are n/a** and reported as losses.
* **Event** (:class:`EventProjection`, AsyncAPI/CloudEvents) — **explicitly
  low-fidelity**: each channel operation is documented as a *non-normative* path with
  a prominent caveat, while pub/sub action, protocol bindings, and correlation ids
  are ``n/a``. Message payloads still reach ``components.schemas``; a "schemas-only"
  mode is recommended.
* **Data-schema** (:class:`DataSchemaProjection`, Avro/Protobuf-schema/JSON-Schema/
  XSD) — **components-only** OpenAPI (types, no ``paths``) unless a service definition
  is also present, in which case its operations get a best-effort binding.

Agent descriptors (A2A/MCP) are normalized into the **RPC** paradigm (a skill/tool is
a request/response method with an input and output schema), so they are projected by
:class:`RpcProjection` and need no separate strategy.

Every strategy is **pure**: given the same model it returns equal bindings and records
equal losses, performs no I/O, and is deterministic.
