"""Project-vs-Catalog import routing — MFI-23.7 (#4016).

A finished import must become one of two things: a **publishable Project** (the
existing OpenAPI/Swagger path) or a **non-publishable catalog item** (MFI-23.1 —
the ``publishable = false`` slice of ``odb.projects``). This module is the single
decision point: given a resolved :class:`~app.import_source.ImportSource` adapter and
the :class:`~app.canonical_model.CanonicalApi` model it produced, it decides which,
and — crucially for the UI — *why*.

The rule (from the roadmap):

* **OpenAPI / Swagger** (including **TypeSpec-emitted OpenAPI**, which a TypeSpec
  adapter normalizes to an ``openapi-3.x`` format) → **Project** (``publishable``),
  exactly as today.
* **Everything else that is OpenAPI-worthy** — a non-OpenAPI import that still carries
  operations and/or types (gRPC, GraphQL, AsyncAPI, OData, …) → **catalog item**
  (non-publishable).
* **Pure data-schema sources** (Avro, Protobuf-schema, JSON-Schema, XSD) — types but no
  operations/channels → **catalog item**, additionally flagged **``schemas_only``** so
  the UI can say *why* it is not an API.

The branch is on the adapter's **emitted format** (``model.format``), not the source
tool, so a tool that emits OpenAPI (TypeSpec) routes to a Project while a tool that
emits anything else routes to the catalog — which is exactly the "and TypeSpec-emitted
OpenAPI" carve-out the ticket calls for.

The decision is **pure** (no I/O): it only reads the canonical model and the adapter's
descriptor, so it is fully unit-testable and the import pipeline (MFI-1.2) can record
it on the import summary for the UI to explain. When the canonical→catalog persistence
hook lands (a later format epic), it consumes :attr:`ImportRoutingDecision.publishable`
to call ``db.create_project(..., publishable=...)`` — ``True`` mints a Project, ``False``
mints a catalog item.
