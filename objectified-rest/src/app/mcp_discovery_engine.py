"""Manual MCP endpoint discovery: trigger an async job and run the Epic-2 client.

V2-MCP-17.2 / MCAT-3.2 (#3664). ``POST /v1/mcp/{tenant_slug}/endpoints/{id}/discover``
creates an ``mcp_discovery_jobs`` row (``trigger='manual'``), then — out of band — runs
the MCP client (transport → handshake → paginated discovery → normalize), fingerprints the
surface, diffs it against the previous snapshot via the canonical surface diff engine
(:func:`app.mcp_client.diff.diff_surfaces`, MCAT-4.2), and persists a new
``mcp_endpoint_versions`` row when the surface changed (or version 1 on first run).

Version-on-change (V2-MCP-18.3 / MCAT-4.3, #3670): a re-discovery whose
``surface_fingerprint`` matches the current version creates **no** new version — it only
stamps ``last_discovered_at`` — so an unchanged server never spams the history. When the
fingerprint differs, exactly one new version is inserted (``version_seq+1``) with its
capability items and the ``previous → new`` diff persisted as ``mcp_version_changes`` rows,
and ``mcp_endpoints.current_version_id`` is advanced to it — all in one transaction.

Date/time tagging (V2-MCP-18.4 / MCAT-4.4, #3671): each new version is stamped with a
human-readable, per-endpoint-unique ``version_tag`` (e.g. ``2026-06-26T14:03Z``) derived from
its discovery time, so version history is navigable by date/time. The tag is carried in the
job ``result`` payload (``version_tag``) on both the changed and unchanged paths.

This mirrors the submit→poll shape of :mod:`spec_import_engine`: the route returns a job
reference immediately and the caller polls the job for the terminal state. Unlike the spec
importer, discovery runs entirely in-process (the MCP client is async Python), so there is no
subprocess — the network/normalize work runs as an asyncio task and the (synchronous,
psycopg2) DB writes are pushed to a worker thread.

De-duplication: concurrent discover requests for the same endpoint coalesce onto one job.
:meth:`Database.enqueue_mcp_discovery_job` makes the "is one already active?" check atomic via
a per-endpoint advisory lock; this module additionally short-circuits the in-process task so a
de-duplicated request never starts a second run.

    """Enqueue a discovery job for an endpoint and start it (in the background) unless de-duplicated.

    The submit→poll entry point for the manual ``POST .../discover`` route (``trigger='manual'``):
    it enqueues the job via :func:`enqueue_discovery_job` and, when a fresh job was created,
    schedules the run as a detached task so the route can return the job reference immediately.
    The periodic sweep does *not* use this (it needs bounded concurrency + per-endpoint timeouts,
    MCAT-5.2); it enqueues with :func:`enqueue_discovery_job` and drives with
    :func:`run_discovery_job` itself.

    Args:
        tenant_id: Owning tenant (stamped on the job for scoped reads).
        endpoint: The already tenant-validated ``mcp_endpoints`` row to discover.
        trigger: How the run was initiated — ``manual`` (default) or ``sweep``. Recorded
            on the job row so its provenance is auditable.

    Returns:
        ``(job_row, deduplicated)`` — when ``deduplicated`` is ``True`` an already-active
        job was returned and no new run was started; otherwise a fresh job was created and
        its discovery task scheduled.
