"""Sandbox security & resource limits for the toolchain runner — MFI-5.3 (#3752).

MFI-5.1 (:mod:`app.toolchain_runner`) runs third-party parser/linter/diff CLIs
(``buf``, ``tsp``, ``smithy``, …) on **user-supplied input**. That is a security surface:
a hostile document can try SSRF (a tool that fetches a ``$ref`` URL), arbitrary code exec,
or resource exhaustion — a zip-bomb spec that explodes to gigabytes of output, or a tool
that spins forever burning CPU. MFI-5.1 already drops ambient secrets from the child
environment and never uses a shell; this module adds the **OS-level clamps** MFI-5.3 owns.

A :class:`SandboxPolicy` describes the constraints applied to every tool subprocess:

* **no network by default** — the child is launched in a fresh Linux *network namespace*
  (via ``unshare(CLONE_NEWUSER | CLONE_NEWNET)``) so it has only a down loopback and cannot
  reach the cloud metadata IP, internal services, or the public internet. Enforcement is
  configurable: ``best_effort`` (the default — isolate when the kernel allows it, otherwise
  log and continue) or ``strict`` (refuse to run the tool if the network cannot be isolated,
  i.e. *fail closed*). A tool that genuinely needs the network for live discovery (gRPC
  reflection, registry crawl) opts in with :meth:`SandboxPolicy.for_live_discovery`, and the
  *caller* is then responsible for routing its fetches through the SSRF guard
  (:mod:`app.ssrf_guard`, EPIC-16.6 / #3612) — the runner's no-network default is the
  belt-and-braces opposite stance.
* **resource limits** — POSIX ``setrlimit`` clamps applied in a ``preexec_fn`` after fork,
  before exec: CPU seconds, address space (memory), output file size, max child processes
  (fork-bomb guard), open files, and a zeroed core-dump limit. Limits the kernel enforces:
  exceeding the CPU cap kills the tool with ``SIGXCPU``; exceeding the file-size cap kills
  it with ``SIGXFSZ`` — both surfaced as :class:`~app.toolchain_runner.ToolResourceLimitError`.
* **input/output size caps** — enforced in the runner itself (not the kernel): an oversized
  ``stdin`` is rejected *before* the tool is spawned, and a tool whose combined stdout+stderr
  exceeds the output cap is killed mid-stream so a zip-bomb can never blow the service's
  memory. These live in the policy here; the runner reads them.

Platform note: the ``setrlimit`` and namespace mechanisms are **POSIX/Linux only**. On a
non-POSIX host (or when the ``resource`` module is unavailable) :func:`build_preexec_fn`
returns ``None`` and only the cross-platform input/output caps apply. Full read-only-root FS
isolation needs a mount namespace / container at deploy time (the runtime image), which is
out of scope for an in-process ``preexec_fn``; what we enforce here — no network, a file-size
cap, no inherited writable handles beyond the pipes — is the in-process half.

    """The OS-level constraints applied to one tool subprocess.

    A field set to ``None`` means *that* clamp is not applied (the kernel default stands).
    The cross-platform input/output caps are read by the runner; the ``setrlimit`` and
    network fields are realised by :func:`build_preexec_fn` in the forked child.

    Attributes:
        no_network: When ``True`` (default), launch the child in an isolated network
            namespace so it cannot reach any network. ``False`` opts the tool into the host
            network (live discovery) — see :meth:`for_live_discovery`.
        network_enforcement: How hard to insist on isolation when ``no_network`` is set —
            ``"best_effort"`` (default) or ``"strict"`` (fail closed). ``"off"`` disables
            isolation entirely (only meaningful with ``no_network=False``).
        cpu_seconds: ``RLIMIT_CPU`` ceiling (CPU-seconds, not wall-clock). ``None`` → no CPU
            clamp; the runner's wall-clock timeout is the primary time bound.
        memory_bytes: ``RLIMIT_AS`` address-space ceiling. ``None`` by default — an
            address-space cap can break JVM tools (``smithy``/``amf`` reserve large virtual
            space), so memory limiting is opt-in per deployment.
        file_size_bytes: ``RLIMIT_FSIZE`` ceiling on any single file the tool writes (a
            zip-bomb-to-disk guard). Exceeding it kills the tool with ``SIGXFSZ``.
        max_processes: ``RLIMIT_NPROC`` ceiling (fork-bomb guard). ``None`` by default —
            ``RLIMIT_NPROC`` is per-UID, so a low value can interfere with co-tenant
            processes on a shared host; opt in where the runtime is isolated.
        open_files: ``RLIMIT_NOFILE`` ceiling on open file descriptors.
        allow_core_dumps: When ``False`` (default) ``RLIMIT_CORE`` is zeroed so a crashing
            tool cannot litter the disk with core files.
        max_input_bytes: Reject (before spawning) a ``stdin`` payload larger than this.
        max_output_bytes: Kill the tool and raise if its combined stdout+stderr exceeds this.
