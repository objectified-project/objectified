"""Refresh-cycle audit + change-report linking (RAR-5.3, #3534).

Each auto-refresh cycle must be auditable for compliance and debugging: *what*
triggered it (scheduled sweep / manual "Refresh Now" / webhook), *what the
freshness gate decided*, *what came out* (a new version / a no-op / a held
divergence / a failure), and *which change report* documents the diff.

This module extends the REPO-12.6 (#2944) ``odb.workflow_audit`` ledger — the same
append-only trail that already records publish/pull/merge — with one dedicated
action, :data:`REFRESH_CYCLE_ACTION`, written once per refresh cycle. The rich,
refresh-specific facets (trigger, file lineage, decision, outcome, and the
change-report / version links) live in the row's ``detail`` JSONB so the existing
ledger schema is reused unchanged (no migration, hence this ticket is
objectified-rest only)::

    refresh cycle ──► audit { trigger, file, decision, version_id, change_report_id, outcome }

The ``workflow_audit.outcome`` *column* keeps its established ``success`` /
``failure`` semantics (a held divergence or a no-op is still a *successful*
cycle); the richer four-valued refresh outcome
(``new-version`` / ``unchanged`` / ``diverged`` / ``failed``) is carried in
``detail.outcome`` and surfaced by the refresh-history query.

The ``repositoryId`` / ``branch`` / ``path`` lineage keys live in ``detail`` so the
history is queryable **per repo and per file**
(:meth:`Database.search_repository_refresh_audit`).

Like the sibling RAR-4.x building blocks, recording here is **best-effort**: it
never raises, so an audit problem can never fail the refresh it describes.
Invoking :func:`record_refresh_cycle` from the EPIC-4 refresh dispatcher — after
the version is created (RAR-4.2) and the change report is generated (RAR-4.3) — is
the dispatcher's job, mirroring how RAR-4.1/4.2/4.3/4.4 deferred their wiring.
