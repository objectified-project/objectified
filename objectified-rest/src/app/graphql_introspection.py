"""GraphQL live introspection — MFI-10.3 (#3772).

The third piece of the GraphQL (graph) import adapter. MFI-10.1 turns *SDL text* into a built
``graphql-core`` schema and MFI-10.2 maps that schema onto the canonical model; this module
covers the **other** way an author hands us a GraphQL API — a **live endpoint** with no SDL
file. It runs the standard introspection query against the endpoint, rebuilds the schema from
the ``__schema`` response, and re-prints it to **canonical SDL** so the result is byte-for-byte
the same artifact the file path produces (:class:`~app.graphql_parser.GraphQlParseResult`) and
flows into the same MFI-10.2 normalizer downstream.

What it does, in one call (:func:`introspect_endpoint`):

* **fetch** — POST ``get_introspection_query()`` to the endpoint over an **SSRF-guarded** httpx
  client (:func:`app.ssrf_guard.build_guarded_client`), so a tenant-supplied URL can never be
  pointed at internal/metadata addresses, on the initial request or any redirect hop. Auth is
  attached from the **credential vault** model (:func:`app.mcp_auth.build_auth_headers`) — the
  same ``none``/``bearer``/``header``/``oauth2`` mapping the MCP discovery path uses — so a
  stored bearer token or custom header authenticates the introspection request. The payload is
  supplied **already decrypted** (decryption is the vault's job, MCAT-6.2); this module reads no
  keys.
* **rebuild** — ``build_client_schema`` turns the ``__schema`` payload back into a live
  :class:`~graphql.GraphQLSchema`, which is re-printed and fed through the MFI-10.1 parser so the
  outcome carries canonical SDL, root operations, and type names exactly like a parsed file.
* **fall back** — when introspection is **disabled** (the common production hardening: the
  server answers with a GraphQL error like *"introspection is not allowed"*, or refuses the
  request), the run does **not** fail if the caller supplied an uploaded ``fallback_sdl``: the
  module parses that instead and records *why* it fell back. With no fallback available, the
  result is simply ``ok=False`` with a human reason — never an unhandled exception.

Validity (and the fallback decision) is a **return value**, not an exception:
:func:`introspect_endpoint` always returns a :class:`GraphQlIntrospectionResult` describing what
happened (which source produced the schema, whether introspection succeeded, whether the
fallback was used, the reason, and the underlying parse result). The one thing that *does* raise
is a misconfigured request the caller must fix — an unsafe URL (:class:`SSRFError`) or a
malformed credential (:class:`~app.mcp_auth.CredentialPayloadError`) — surfaced as
:class:`GraphQlIntrospectionError` so a route can return a 4xx.
