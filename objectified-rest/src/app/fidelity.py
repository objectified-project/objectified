"""Fidelity / completeness gap analyzer — MFI-22.3 (#4004).

The emitter (:mod:`app.openapi_emitter`, MFI-22.1) turns a
:class:`~app.canonical_model.CanonicalApi` into an OpenAPI 3.1 document, and the
paradigm projections (:mod:`app.projection`, MFI-22.2) declare — as
:class:`~app.emitter.Loss` records — what each non-REST source could *not* carry
faithfully onto OpenAPI's path/verb/response vocabulary. Both leave a trail: the
emitter tags **every emitted value** with a :class:`~app.emitter.Provenance`
(``source`` / ``inferred`` / ``default``) and the projection records its
``inferred`` / ``n/a`` losses. *This* module reads that trail — the
:class:`~app.emitter.EmitResult` plus the source model — and answers the question a
user must see *before* committing a conversion: **what will the converted spec
contain, what did the conversion have to invent, and what did it lose?**

It produces a structured :class:`FidelityReport`:

* a **completeness checklist** (:class:`ChecklistItem`) — one row per load-bearing
  OpenAPI construct (``info`` fields, ``servers``, ``paths``, ``operationId``,
  parameters, ``requestBody``, ``responses``, ``components.schemas``, security,
  ``tags``, ``examples``, ``externalDocs``, ``deprecated``). Each row carries a
  :class:`Coverage` tag (``present`` / ``inferred`` / ``partial`` / ``missing`` /
  ``n/a``), a count, up to a few example coordinates, and a human-readable reason
  ("source declares no servers", "gRPC method has no media types");

* the **enumerated projection losses** carried straight through from the
  :class:`~app.emitter.EmitResult`, so a pub/sub action or a GraphQL subscription is
  shown, not silently dropped;

* a rolled-up **fidelity score** (0-100) and **A-F grade** — reusing the house
  grade bands (:data:`app.schema_lint.GRADE_THRESHOLDS`, the MFI-4.2 banding) so a
  fidelity grade reads like a lint grade — weighted by how *load-bearing* each
  inferred/partial/missing construct is, plus a per-loss penalty; and

* a coarse **fidelity tier** (``high`` / ``medium`` / ``low``) derived from the
  score, which the conversion preview (MFI-22.4) uses to scale how strong its
  warning is.

The analyzer is **pure and deterministic**: no DB or network, checklist rows in a
fixed order, examples sorted and capped, so the same ``(api, result)`` always yields
an equal report.
