"""In-process import-source job pipeline — MFI-1.2 (#3734).

The spec-import job engine (:mod:`app.spec_import_engine`) was OpenAPI-shaped: every
job ran the ``objectified-ui`` ``tsx`` worker, which only knows how to import an
OpenAPI/Swagger document. MFI-1.1 (#3733) introduced the :class:`ImportSource` SPI so
a *format* is added by registering an adapter; this module is the generalized engine
step that **drives any such adapter through the existing job lifecycle** —
parse → normalize → version → lint — emitting the same
:class:`~app.models.SpecImportJobStatus` contract the worker already produces.

The four phases map onto the SPI:

* **parse** — :meth:`ImportSource.parse` turns the raw document text into the
  format's native AST;
* **normalize** — :meth:`ImportSource.normalize` maps that AST onto the canonical
  model (:class:`~app.canonical_model.CanonicalApi`);
* **version** — :meth:`ImportSource.fingerprint` computes the stable content
  fingerprint that *identifies* this revision (the unit ``skip_duplicate_versions``
  and incremental imports key off);
* **lint** — :meth:`ImportSource.lint` scores the normalized model.

The OpenAPI/Swagger path keeps running on the ``tsx`` worker (it persists a full
catalog project/version and has its own benchmark instrumentation). This path handles
every *other* format and now **persists** its result via the canonical→catalog hook
(:func:`persist_adapter_import`): a non-dry-run import writes its routed artifact and
keeps the **original source verbatim** in the revision's ``format_metadata`` so it can
be converted to OpenAPI later (MFI-EPIC-22) — nothing is converted at import time. A
``dry_run`` still previews without writing. The completed job's ``summary`` carries the
fingerprint, paradigm/format, entity counts, lint score, the Project-vs-Catalog
**routing decision** (MFI-23.7, :mod:`app.import_routing`), and a ``persisted`` flag;
its ``result`` carries the produced project/version ids.

Between normalize and version the pipeline records a routing decision — OpenAPI/Swagger
imports route to a publishable **Project**, everything else to a non-publishable
**catalog item** — onto the summary (and a ``ROUTING_DECIDED`` event) so the UI can
explain where an import landed and why; the persistence hook then creates that artifact
with ``db.create_project(publishable=routing.publishable)``.

The driver is intentionally transport-agnostic: it takes a resolved adapter and the
worker payload dict, calls an optional ``on_snapshot`` coroutine after every phase so
the engine can publish poll-visible progress, and checks an optional ``is_canceled``
predicate between phases. This mirrors the MCP discovery-job driver: a small async
state machine over a registry-resolved adapter.

The adapter's parse/normalize/fingerprint/lint calls run inline (not on a worker
thread): these adapters handle bounded new-format documents, and the one heavy path —
OpenAPI/Swagger — stays on the subprocess worker. Keeping the work inline means a job
runs to a terminal state within a single event-loop turn, the same way the worker's
final-status callback resolves, which the job engine and its tests rely on. A future
format with genuinely CPU-bound parsing can move its own step to a thread/subprocess.
