"""In-process import-source job pipeline — MFI-1.2 (#3734).

The spec-import job engine (:mod:`app.spec_import_engine`) was OpenAPI-shaped: every
job ran the ``objectified-ui`` ``tsx`` worker, which only knows how to import an
OpenAPI/Swagger document. MFI-1.1 (#3733) introduced the :class:`ImportSource` SPI so
a *format* is added by registering an adapter; this module is the generalized engine
step that **drives any such adapter through the existing job lifecycle** —
parse → normalize → version → lint — emitting the same
:class:`~app.models.SpecImportJobStatus` contract the worker already produces.

The four phases map onto the SPI:

* **parse** — :meth:`ImportSource.parse` turns the raw document text into the
  format's native AST;
* **normalize** — :meth:`ImportSource.normalize` maps that AST onto the canonical
  model (:class:`~app.canonical_model.CanonicalApi`);
* **version** — :meth:`ImportSource.fingerprint` computes the stable content
  fingerprint that *identifies* this revision (the unit ``skip_duplicate_versions``
  and incremental imports key off);
* **lint** — :meth:`ImportSource.lint` scores the normalized model.

The OpenAPI/Swagger path keeps running on the ``tsx`` worker (it persists a full
catalog project/version and has its own benchmark instrumentation), so this path is
**preview-only**: it does not write to the catalog — canonical→catalog persistence is
a per-format epic (MFI-2.2 / the format epics this ticket *blocks*). It therefore
honors ``dry_run`` / ``incremental_mode`` by recording the requested mode in the
event stream and summary; with no writes yet, both modes behave identically while the
persistence hook is still pending. The result is a completed job whose ``summary``
carries the fingerprint, paradigm/format, entity counts, and lint score — i.e. an
adapter "runs end-to-end through the existing job API" (the ticket's acceptance
criterion) without the worker.

The driver is intentionally transport-agnostic: it takes a resolved adapter and the
worker payload dict, calls an optional ``on_snapshot`` coroutine after every phase so
the engine can publish poll-visible progress, and checks an optional ``is_canceled``
predicate between phases. This mirrors the MCP discovery-job driver: a small async
state machine over a registry-resolved adapter.

The adapter's parse/normalize/fingerprint/lint calls run inline (not on a worker
thread): these adapters handle bounded new-format documents, and the one heavy path —
OpenAPI/Swagger — stays on the subprocess worker. Keeping the work inline means a job
runs to a terminal state within a single event-loop turn, the same way the worker's
final-status callback resolves, which the job engine and its tests rely on. A future
format with genuinely CPU-bound parsing can move its own step to a thread/subprocess.
