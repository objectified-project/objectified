"""Feature-entitlement gating dependencies for the Primitives type registry (#3478).

The advanced Type Registry surface — relative-``$ref`` resolver, namespaces, registry
settings, coverage stats, and the import pipeline — can optionally be gated behind a
per-tenant ``primitives-registry`` entitlement. Baseline primitives CRUD and ``/health``
are never gated.

The gate is itself controlled by an operator switch
(``settings.primitives_registry_gating_enabled``, default ``False``):

* **Gating disabled (default):** these dependencies are pure pass-throughs that return the
  authenticated ``auth_data`` unchanged — current behavior, every authenticated tenant
  reaches the advanced routes.
* **Gating enabled:** the calling tenant/user must hold the ``primitives-registry`` feature
  flag (per-user override > per-tenant override > license default, see
  ``Database.tenant_has_feature_flag``). Non-entitled callers receive ``403``.

Each gated route swaps its ``Depends(validate_authentication)`` for
``Depends(require_primitives_registry)``. Because the gate depends on
``validate_authentication`` and returns the same ``auth_data`` dict, route handlers are
otherwise unchanged, and tests that override ``validate_authentication`` keep working (the
override resolves the sub-dependency).
