"""Manual one-shot "Refresh Now" (RAR-5.2, #3533).

Extends the REPO-9.5 "Import Now" idea into a *spec-faithful* refresh that a user
can trigger on demand — for a single imported file or for a whole repository —
without waiting for the next auto-refresh tick. It reuses the exact enqueue core
of the periodic sweep (:func:`repository_refresh_sweep.enqueue_stale_files_for_branch`),
so the same gates apply:

- **Stored spec, not defaults.** Each enqueued job carries the captured
  ``SpecImportOptions`` snapshot (RAR-1.2) so the EPIC-4 executor replays the
  user's original request (RAR-4.1).
- **Freshness gate honored.** Only files genuinely newer than the last import
  enqueue (RAR-2.2 newer-than comparator); an up-to-date file is a no-op.
- **Divergence guard honored.** The job runs through the same EPIC-4 executor as
  an auto-refresh, which applies the RAR-4.4 manual-edit divergence guard before
  overwriting.

What it deliberately does **not** honor is the *cadence* and the auto-refresh
opt-outs: unlike the sweep, this path does not consult
``list_due_repositories`` / ``mark_repository_refreshed``, the per-repo
``auto_refresh_enabled`` flag (RAR-3.3), or the global ``OBJECTIFIED_REFRESH_ENABLED``
kill switch. A manual refresh works even when scheduled auto-refresh is disabled —
that is the whole point of the button.

    Resolves the repository, picks the branches to evaluate, and enqueues a
    spec-faithful re-import for every stale + newer file (per-file when ``path``
    is given, otherwise the whole repository). The cadence and auto-refresh
    opt-outs are intentionally bypassed; the freshness gate (RAR-2.2) and the
    downstream divergence guard (RAR-4.4) are still honored.

    Branch selection:
      - ``branch`` given → only that branch is evaluated.
      - ``branch`` omitted → every branch that has a stored import spec for this
        repository is evaluated (the same set the sweep walks).

        tenant_id: Owning tenant id (scopes the repository lookup).
        repository_id: The repository to refresh.

        path: Optional repository-relative file path for a per-file refresh; when
            omitted, the whole repository (all selected branches) is refreshed.
