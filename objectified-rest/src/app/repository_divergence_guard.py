"""
Manual-edit divergence guard for repository auto-refresh (RAR-4.4, #3530).

A spec-faithful auto-refresh (RAR-4.1) re-imports a changed source file and
supersedes the catalog version the original import produced (RAR-4.2). Nothing
on that path checks whether a human edited that version **in Objectified** after
the original import. Without a guard, the refresh would silently overwrite those
hand edits — a data-loss risk.

This module is that guard. It compares the *current* version's content lineage
to the snapshot the original import produced (a stored post-import checksum) and
decides whether the refresh may proceed:

    last import snapshot == current  -> safe: apply the refresh
    last import snapshot != current  -> DIVERGED: hold + flag (no overwrite)

The default policy is **hold-not-clobber**: a detected manual edit blocks the
silent overwrite, the file is flagged ``diverged`` (which
:func:`repository_refresh_status.compute_refresh_status` surfaces as the
``diverged`` state), and the divergence is surfaced for review and notification
(RAR-5.1 / RAR-5.4). A future per-repo/file policy (RAR-4.5) can opt into
overwriting a diverged version; this module accepts that policy as a parameter
so the dispatcher can pass it through without a second decision site.

Like the RAR-2.2 comparator and the RAR-2.4 idempotency guard, this is a pure,
side-effect-free decision function so it can be exercised by deterministic
fixtures. The caller supplies the two content identities (or the raw content via
:func:`compute_content_checksum`); capturing the post-import snapshot at import
time and persisting the ``diverged`` flag / firing the notification on a HOLD is
the EPIC-4 dispatcher's job, mirroring how RAR-4.1/4.2/4.3 deferred their
persistence and wiring.
