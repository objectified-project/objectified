"""Periodic MCP endpoint re-discovery sweep — cadence-driven, bounded executor (MCAT-5.1/5.2).

The MCP catalog's manual discovery (MCAT-3.2, :mod:`mcp_discovery_engine`) re-handshakes a
single endpoint on demand. This module is the *periodic* counterpart: a background async loop
(wired in :mod:`app.main`) that, on every tick, asks the database for the endpoints whose
discovery cadence has elapsed and runs a fresh discovery for each, mirroring the repository
auto-refresh sweep (:mod:`repository_refresh_sweep`).

Due-selection (:meth:`Database.list_due_mcp_endpoints`) does all the policy work: it returns
only live (``deleted_at IS NULL``), enabled endpoints whose ``last_discovered_at`` is older than
their effective cadence — the per-endpoint ``discovery_cadence_seconds`` override, or the global
``mcp_discovery_default_cadence_seconds`` when the endpoint has none. Endpoints are returned
oldest-first so attention is spread fairly and a never-discovered endpoint is picked up promptly.

Each due endpoint runs through the *same* discovery → diff → version pipeline the manual route
uses (MCAT-3.2/4.x): the sweep enqueues a job tagged ``trigger='sweep'`` via
:func:`mcp_discovery_engine.enqueue_discovery_job`, then drives it with
:func:`mcp_discovery_engine.run_discovery_job`. The shared pipeline is what gives the
acceptance criteria for free — a re-discovery whose surface fingerprint is unchanged creates no
new version (it only stamps ``last_discovered_at``), and a changed surface produces exactly one
new version. Enqueue de-duplication (per-endpoint advisory lock + active-state check) makes the
loop idempotent and singleton-safe: a still-running discovery from a previous tick is never
double-started, and two overlapping sweep ticks never both kick off a run for the same endpoint.

**Bounded execution (MCAT-5.2).** Unlike MCAT-5.1's fire-and-forget dispatch, a tick now *runs*
the due endpoints under two bounds so a large backlog or one hostile server cannot overwhelm the
process:

* **Concurrency cap** — at most ``mcp_discovery_max_concurrency`` discovery runs execute at once
  (a semaphore); the rest queue. The tick awaits all runs before returning, which also provides
  natural backpressure (the next tick cannot pile on more work while this one is still draining).
* **Per-endpoint timeout** — each run is bounded by ``mcp_discovery_endpoint_timeout_seconds``;
  an overrun is recorded as a ``budget_exceeded`` failure (handled inside ``run_discovery_job``)
  so one slow endpoint can never hold a slot indefinitely.

The global ``mcp_discovery_enabled`` kill switch short-circuits the whole tick: when disabled the
sweep selects nothing and runs nothing, so operators can halt all auto-discovery for incident
response without touching per-endpoint state. Manual discovery (MCAT-3.2) does not run through this
sweep and is unaffected.

    """Run one re-discovery sweep tick: discover every due endpoint, bounded (MCAT-5.1/5.2).

    Selects the endpoints due for re-discovery (cadence elapsed; disabled/deleted excluded),
    enqueues a ``trigger='sweep'`` job for each (coalescing onto an already-active job where one
    exists), then drives the freshly-created jobs through the shared discovery→diff→version
    pipeline under a concurrency cap, each bounded by a per-endpoint timeout. A run that
    de-duplicates onto an already-active job (a prior tick still in flight, or a concurrent manual
    run) is not counted and not driven here. One endpoint failing to enqueue never aborts the rest
    of the tick, and one run failing/timing out never aborts the others.

    The tick awaits all dispatched runs before returning, so the concurrency cap is enforced for
    real and the next tick cannot start more work while this one is still draining.

    The global ``mcp_discovery_enabled`` kill switch halts the tick entirely (returns 0 without
    selecting, enqueuing, or running anything).

    Args:
        db: Database handle for this tick. The blocking due-selection query is pushed to a worker
            thread (psycopg2 is synchronous); the discovery runs themselves are async (the MCP
            client is asyncio) and push only their blocking DB writes to worker threads.

    Returns:
        The number of endpoints for which a *new* discovery run was dispatched this tick (0 when
        the kill switch is disabled or nothing was due). De-duplicated endpoints are excluded.
