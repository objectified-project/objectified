## [1.0.19] - 2026-06-22

### Added
- **`$ref` rewrite + namespace/scope mapping (#3463)** — imported definitions now have their refs
  rewritten for their committed place in the registry instead of carrying document-local pointers.
  New `app/primitives_rewrite.py` provides `rewrite_import_schema()`, which (1) rewrites every
  intra-source pointer (`#/$defs/Money`, `#/definitions/Money`, `#/types/Money`) to a relative
  registry ref at the sibling's committed `$id` (`./money`, matching the `$id` leaf-slug; a deeper
  pointer like `#/$defs/Money/properties/c` is preserved as `./money#/properties/c`), and (2) maps a
  recognized string `format` (`email`, `uuid`, `uri`, `date`, `date-time`, `time`) to its seeded
  `std/v0/types` core type by injecting a relative `$ref` (mirroring the seed's
  `{"$ref": "../primitives/string", "format": "email"}` shape; an author's explicit `$ref` is never
  overridden). Because both rewrites produce ordinary registry-relative `$ref` values, the existing
  resolver (#3456) turns them into persisted `refs` edges with no separate internal-edge bookkeeping
  — so imported refs are stored relative and resolve via Epic 3, and core-format mapping resolves to
  the core type. `POST /v1/primitives/{tenant_slug}/import` applies this on commit for both the JSON
  Schema and type-def-bundle paths; a new `map_core_formats` request flag (default `true`) toggles
  the format mapping, and the import report gains a per-type `rewrites` map for the review table.

### Changed
- **Import commit no longer persists `internal` ref edges (#3463).** The `$defs`/`types` sibling
  pointers that #3461/#3462 captured as `{status: "internal"}` edges are now rewritten to relative
  registry refs and resolved like any other edge, so a committed primitive's `refs` carries only
  `resolved`/`unresolved` edges. (The staging path's per-candidate `internal_refs` metadata is
  unchanged.)

## [1.0.18] - 2026-06-22

### Added
- **Type-definition bundle importer (#3462)** — the `type-def-bundle` source kind now expands into
  many interlinked primitives instead of being enumerated shallowly. New `app/primitives_bundle.py`
  provides `parse_type_def_bundle()` (a parsed `.json`/`.yaml` bundle → discrete types) and
  `expand_zip_bundle()` (a `.zip` archive whose JSON/YAML members are each one type → a merged bundle
  document). A bundle reads its types from a `types` container (`$defs`/`definitions` accepted as
  equivalents); each type captures its **inter-type** `$ref` edges — refs at a sibling bundle type
  (`#/types/Money`, `#/$defs/Money`, `#/definitions/Money`) — as `internal` edges in the `refs` JSONB
  column for the rewrite stage (#3463), and is validated against draft 2020-12. The staging pipeline
  (`POST /import/stage`) now deep-parses bundle candidates (internal refs + per-type validation,
  matching the JSON Schema path), and `POST /v1/primitives/{tenant_slug}/import` with
  `source_kind='type-def-bundle'` commits a bundle of N types as N `odb.primitives` rows with their
  refs intact. A malformed bundle (no recognizable container, no usable types, bad/oversized/duplicate
  zip members) is rejected with a clear 400 / `BundleError` message. The per-definition commit loop is
  shared by the JSON Schema and bundle paths via `_commit_imported_definitions()`.

## [1.0.16] - 2026-06-22

### Added
- **Import pipeline core + ingestion (#3460)** — new `POST /v1/primitives/{tenant_slug}/import/stage`,
  the single orchestration path for all import sources. It ingests a document by one of four
  methods — `paste` / `file` (inline text), `url` (http/https fetch), or `git` (a file from a public
  github.com repo, reusing the repository-scan fetcher) — parses it as JSON **or** YAML, and detects
  the candidate types it carries, dispatched on source kind: `$defs`/`definitions` for `json-schema`
  (a bare document is one candidate), the `types`/`$defs` container for `type-def-bundle`, and
  `components.schemas` for `openapi`. The result is *staged*, not committed — each candidate carries
  its JSON Pointer and `$ref` count for the downstream parse (#3461/#3462), `$ref` rewrite (#3463),
  and conflict review (#3464) stages. Every staged import records an auditable `staged`
  `odb.primitive_imports` row (reusing #3448; no new table). The legacy paste-and-commit
  `POST /v1/primitives/{tenant_slug}/import` is unchanged. New `app/import_ingestion.py` (per-method
  fetch + JSON/YAML parse), `app/import_pipeline.py` (pure detection + staging), and
  `PrimitiveImportStageRequest` / `PrimitiveImportStageResult` / `StagedTypeCandidate` /
  `GitSourceLocator` models.

## [1.0.13] - 2026-06-22

### Added
- **Resolver API + dependency listing (#3459)** — new `POST /v1/types/{tenant_slug}/resolve`
  re-resolves every `$ref` dependency edge across the tenant's primitives against the *current*
  registry state and returns the per-primitive dependency listing the resolver UI (#3470) and
  Designer consume. Each stored edge's `resolved`/`unresolved` status is recomputed with the same
  existence test as save-time resolution (#3456) — so a target created since the edge was last
  computed now resolves and a deleted one now dangles — and the refreshed edges are persisted for
  the tenant's own primitives whose status changed ("re-resolve updates statuses"). Each resolved
  edge is enriched with its dependency target's id and name so the response is the dependency
  graph. The top-level counts mirror the coverage KPIs of `GET …/unresolved` (#3457/#3454), plus
  `reresolved_primitive_count` for how many primitives this pass updated. New `ResolveResponse` /
  `ResolvedPrimitiveRefs` / `ResolvedRefEdge` models and `app/type_resolver.py` (pure edge
  re-evaluation + dependency enrichment); system-core rows are listed but never written back.

## [1.0.12] - 2026-06-22

### Added
- **Unresolved-reference detection, flags & counts (#3457)** — a primitive's relative `$ref`
  edges are resolved and flagged `resolved`/`unresolved` on save/import (#3456); this adds the
  detection surface and the re-resolve-clears behavior on top of it. New
  `GET /v1/primitives/{tenant_slug}/unresolved` returns the tenant's total unresolved-edge count,
  the number of affected primitives, and a per-primitive breakdown (each with only its unresolved
  edges) — feeding the registry coverage/stats KPIs (#3454) and the resolver UI (#3470). New
  `UnresolvedRefsResponse`/`UnresolvedRefPrimitive` models and DB aggregates
  `count_unresolved_refs` / `get_primitives_with_unresolved_refs` (scoped to the caller's tenant,
  aggregating over the `odb.primitives.refs` JSONB column). Creating, importing, or repinning a
  primitive now runs a best-effort reconcile (`mark_refs_resolved_to_target`) that clears the
  unresolved flag on the tenant's other primitives whose dangling edge pointed at the new type's
  `$id`, so "fixing the target clears on re-resolve" without re-saving each dependent by hand.

## [1.0.11] - 2026-06-22

### Added
- **Type definition draft 2020-12 validation (#3452)** — the Primitives create, update, and
  import endpoints now strictly validate the supplied `schema` against the JSON Schema
  **draft 2020-12 meta-schema** server-side (new `app/schema_validation.py`, backed by the
  `jsonschema` library). An invalid schema is rejected at the REST boundary with HTTP 422 and a
  structured, field-level `errors` list (`path` / `message` / `keyword`) instead of being
  persisted. Valid types persist with a stable, derived JSON Schema `$id` (the
  `odb.primitives.schema_id` column) — an author-declared `$id` is honored, otherwise it is
  computed from the namespace base URI (or a stable tenant-default base) plus a url-safe slug of
  the name — and a stamped `draft` (default `2020-12`, read from `$schema`). The stored schema
  document is stamped with its `$id`/`$schema` so it is self-describing. `PrimitiveCreateRequest`/
  `PrimitiveUpdateRequest` gained optional `namespace`/`base_uri` placement fields (and `enabled`
  on update); `PrimitiveSchema` now exposes `schema_id`/`draft`/`namespace`/`base_uri`. The import
  path runs the same validator per `$defs` definition, recording invalid definitions in the import
  report (`error: "invalid_schema"` with `details`) without blocking the valid ones.

## [1.0.10] - 2026-06-22

### Added
- **Namespace CRUD API (#3451)** — added the type-registry namespace endpoints
  `GET/POST/PUT /v1/types/{tenant_slug}/namespaces` over the existing `objectified-db`
  connection. Namespaces (scope, base URI, version root, visibility, default) are persisted in
  the new `odb.type_namespaces` table, whose `namespace`/`base_uri` columns mirror those on
  `odb.primitives` (the type-count join key). `GET` lists system-core (`std/*`) namespaces plus
  the caller tenant's own, each with its tenant-scoped type count. `POST`/`PUT` require a tenant
  administrator and operate on tenant-owned namespaces only; the namespace path is immutable, and
  base URI / version root are derived from the path when omitted. System-core namespaces are
  platform-governed and read-only via the API (no platform-admin role is exposed), so creating or
  modifying one returns 403. Backed by `TypeNamespaceSchema`/`TypeNamespaceCreateRequest`/
  `TypeNamespaceUpdateRequest` models and `Database.list/get/create/update_type_namespace()` DAOs.

## [1.0.9] - 2026-06-22

### Added
- **Type-registry service skeleton + health (#3450)** — added an anonymous
  registry-layer health/ping endpoint `GET /v1/primitives/health` that reports the
  `objectified-db` connection status backing the registry's `odb.primitives` storage
  (overall `status`, `connection`, and whether the storage table is present). The existing
  tenant-scoped primitive CRUD/import endpoints are unchanged and remain authenticated, so
  current clients are unaffected. Backed by a new `Database.registry_ping()` probe and a
  `RegistryHealthResponse` model.

## [1.0.8] - 2026-06-22

### Added
- **Primitive import provenance & property binding (#3448)** — every
  `POST /v1/primitives/{tenant}/import` now records an auditable provenance row in the new
  `odb.primitive_imports` table (source kind, options, and a JSON outcome report with
  imported/skipped/errors) and marks imported primitives `source='imported'`. New read
  endpoints `GET /v1/primitives/{tenant}/imports` and `GET /v1/primitives/{tenant}/imports/{id}`
  expose the history and its report. Class properties gained a `primitive_id` foreign key to
  `odb.primitives` plus a stored `primitive_ref`, surfaced on the Designer read path so a bound
  property reloads its `$ref`; bindings are carried through class and version copies.

## [1.0.7] - 2026-06-22

### Removed
- **Separate type-registry database (#3447)** — removed the separate type-registry database
  and its dedicated REST connection, configuration, and health reporting. The type registry
  now lives in the main `objectified-db` database; `GET /health` reports only the core
  database status again. Reverses #3446.
