# Changelog

All notable changes to the Objectified REST API will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [1.26.0] - 2026-06-28

### Added
- **Normalizer SPI (#3740, MFI-2.3)** — the contract + base utilities that turn a parsed source
  document of any API format into the MFI-2.1 canonical model (`app.canonical_model.CanonicalApi`),
  so each format epic writes only its own mapping. `app.normalizer` provides: the `Normalizer`
  abstract contract (`format` + `paradigm` identity, a single `normalize()` method) with a
  by-format-key registry (`register_normalizer`/`get_normalizer`/`available_formats`, plus a
  `register=True` class flag); `Keys`, deterministic stable-key builders matching the documented
  key grammar (`GET /pets/{id}`, `GET /pets/{id}#path.id`, `User.email`, …) so diffs line up by
  identity; `coerce_constraints` + `SchemaCoercer`, which map a JSON-Schema fragment into canonical
  `TypeRef`/`Constraints`/named `Type`s (reusing the JSON-Schema vocabulary — OpenAPI 3.1 schemas
  *are* JSON Schema — including both the 3.1 numeric and 3.0 boolean `exclusiveMinimum/Maximum`
  forms); and `normalize_ordering`, which sorts identity-keyed collections so output is byte-stable
  regardless of source declaration order. The reference implementation `app.openapi_normalizer`
  (`OpenApiNormalizer`) maps a parsed **OpenAPI 3.0/3.1** document into a REST `CanonicalApi`
  (info→identity, servers, `components.schemas`→types, paths→operations grouped by tag,
  parameters, request/response messages with payload refs/inline schemas and headers) and
  self-registers both `openapi-3.0` and `openapi-3.1`. Documented in `docs/normalizer_spi.md`;
  SPI/utility tests in `tests/test_normalizer.py` and end-to-end reference-normalizer tests in
  `tests/test_openapi_normalizer.py`.

## [1.25.0] - 2026-06-28

### Added
- **Canonical API model (#3738, MFI-2.1)** — one paradigm-agnostic internal model
  (`app.canonical_model.CanonicalApi`) that every importable API description format normalizes into,
  so versioning/fingerprint/diff/lint/browse are written once across REST, RPC, event-driven, graph,
  and data-schema paradigms. The model is a tree — artifact → services → operations
  (`kind` + `streaming` + verb/route) → parameters/messages, plus channels (event addresses/bindings)
  and types (record/enum/union/scalar/alias/map) with fields carrying nullability-and-list-aware
  `TypeRef`s, defaults, protobuf field numbers, and JSON-Schema-vocabulary constraints. Every entity
  carries a deterministic stable `key` (GraphQL coordinates / protobuf field numbers / XSD QNames) so
  diffs line up by identity, plus an `extras` bag (and a top-level `raw` AST bag) so normalization is
  lossy-but-never-destructive. Plain Pydantic v2, so it round-trips to/from JSONB losslessly for the
  MFI-2.2 persistence tables. Documented in `docs/canonical_model.md`; paradigm-coverage and
  round-trip tests in `tests/test_canonical_model.py`.

## [1.24.0] - 2026-06-27

### Added
- **Capability search index & query (#3692, V2-MCP-23.2 / MCAT-9.2)** — tenant-scoped free-text
  search over the MCP catalog. `GET /v1/mcp/{tenant_slug}/search?q=…` matches the caller's *current*
  capability surface, backed by the V127 capability-item `tsvector` GIN index (the `@@` predicate
  reuses the index's exact expression, so the index does the matching). `scope` selects what is
  searched — a single capability kind (`tool` / `resource` / `resource_template` / `prompt`), every
  capability kind (omit `scope`), or the endpoints themselves (`scope=endpoint`, matched on
  name + description + category). Hits are ranked by full-text relevance then quality score, and the
  `host` / `category` / `grade` / `visibility` filters compose. Each hit carries its owning
  endpoint's browse context (host, category, score/grade, visibility) and a credential-redacted URL,
  so a result renders without a second read. Like every catalog route, scoping comes from the token's
  `tenant_id` (never the URL slug), so a search only ever returns the caller's own catalog; the
  public-directory variant waits on the MCAT-1.6 public read view. `limit` (1–200, default 50) and
  `offset` paginate.

## [1.23.0] - 2026-06-27

### Added
- **Private browse: endpoints & detail (#3691, V2-MCP-23.1 / MCAT-9.1)** — a tenant-scoped browse
  read over the MCP catalog for the ADE browse view. `GET /v1/mcp/{tenant_slug}/browse` returns every
  live endpoint the caller's tenant owns, bucketed by the host its URL points at, each carrying its
  *current* version snapshot's capability counts (tools / resources / resource templates / prompts),
  quality score/grade, and last-discovered time. Hosts are derived from the stored URL (credentials
  redacted) and the groups are returned in alphabetical host order with per-host endpoint/capability
  totals. Like every catalog route, scoping comes from the token's `tenant_id` (never the URL slug),
  so a tenant only ever browses its own catalog. The browse *detail* half reuses the existing endpoint
  and version-detail reads (tools/resources/prompts + version/score).

## [1.22.0] - 2026-06-27

### Added
- **Invocation logging & safety guards (#3689, V2-MCP-22.3 / MCAT-8.3)** — wraps the test-harness
  route (`POST /v1/mcp/{tenant_slug}/endpoints/{id}/test`) with an audit log and two safety gates so
  a live test call against an external MCP server is recorded, never fired destructively by accident,
  and cannot flood the target.
  - **Redacted invocation log** — every *dispatched* call is recorded in `odb.mcp_test_invocations`
    (endpoint, version, item, outcome, latency, acting user). Secrets never reach the log: the
    request's auth headers are not part of the row at all, and both the `arguments` and the response
    payload are passed through a new `redact_sensitive_args` helper that masks any secret-named field
    (`token`, `password`, `authorization`, `api_key`, …) before storage. The new row id is returned
    as `invocationId`. Logging is **best-effort** — a DB failure is swallowed (warning logged) and
    never fails the call, since the live invocation has already happened.
  - **Destructive/open-world confirm gate** — a tool whose annotations assert `destructiveHint` or
    `openWorldHint` (as a JSON `true`) is refused with `428` unless the request sets `confirm=true`,
    so an irreversible or open-world tool is never invoked without explicit acknowledgement. A hint
    that is absent or not a clean boolean is treated as unset (no spurious gate).
  - **Per-endpoint rate limit** — accepted, fully-validated calls are throttled per endpoint with an
    in-process fixed window (`429` with `Retry-After` when exhausted), in addition to the global
    per-tenant middleware, so the console cannot flood the external server. Honours the global
    `rate_limit_enabled` kill switch; the ceiling is `OBJECTIFIED_MCP_TEST_RATE_LIMIT_PER_MINUTE`
    (default 30).
  - New `confirm` request field and `invocation_id` response field; new
    `insert_mcp_test_invocation` DB method (reuses the existing `mcp_test_invocations` table from
    V130 — no schema changes). Tests: 15 route/unit tests over a mocked DB and invocation service
    (redaction of secret args + secrets echoed in responses, the `is_error`/latency log shaping,
    best-effort log failure, headers never logged, the confirm gate for both hints + the safe/
    non-boolean cases, and the rate-limit enforce/disable paths) plus the pure `redact_sensitive_args`
    helper.

## [1.21.0] - 2026-06-27

### Added
- **Test-harness REST endpoints (#3688, V2-MCP-22.2 / MCAT-8.2)** — exposes the MCP invocation
  service (MCAT-8.1) to the UI/CLI as a single tenant-scoped route:
  `POST /v1/mcp/{tenant_slug}/endpoints/{id}/test` with
  `{item_type, item_name, arguments?, auth_override?, timeout_seconds?}`.
  - Names a `tool`/`resource`/`prompt` on the endpoint's **current** discovered surface, looks it
    up in `mcp_capability_items`, and dispatches to the matching method (`tools/call`,
    `resources/read` against the resource's stored concrete `uri`, or `prompts/get`).
  - **Argument validation before the call leaves the server**: a tool's `arguments` are validated
    against its stored JSON Schema `inputSchema` with `jsonschema` (→ `422` on mismatch); a prompt's
    against its declared required arguments. A malformed *stored* schema (the server's fault) is not
    held against the caller — local validation is skipped and the remote server is left to reject.
  - **Optional ephemeral auth override** (`auth_override: {auth_type, payload}`) used for this one
    call only — validated through the same auth-type model that gates stored credentials and **never
    persisted**; when omitted, the endpoint's stored credential is used. `auth_type: none` overrides
    a stored credential to test anonymously.
  - **Per-call timeout** (`timeout_seconds`, 1–120s, default 30) bounds each request in the
    connect → handshake → invoke sequence. The response carries the three outcomes distinctly
    (success / tool-level `isError` / classified transport failure) with `latency_ms`. A remote-server
    failure is reported **in-band** (`completed=false` with a classified `error`), not as a 5xx.
  - Scoped to the caller's token tenant (cross-tenant id → `404`); `409` when the endpoint has no
    discovered surface yet; `404` when the named capability is not on the current surface.
  - New `McpEndpointTestRequest` / `McpAuthOverride` / `McpEndpointTestResponse` models. Tests: 23
    route tests over a mocked DB and invocation service (the three outcomes, schema-invalid args,
    resource/prompt dispatch, ephemeral override applied + not persisted, timeout pass-through,
    tenant scoping, and the not-found/not-discovered/bad-input guards). No schema changes.

## [1.20.0] - 2026-06-27

### Added
- **MCP tool invocation service (#3687, V2-MCP-22.1 / MCAT-8.1)** — the in-process core of the
  MCP query & test harness: connect to a cataloged endpoint with the Epic-2 client, attach its
  stored Epic-6 credentials, invoke one capability, and report content, `isError`, and latency.
  - New `app/mcp_invoke.py` with `invoke_tool` (`tools/call`), `read_resource` (`resources/read`),
    and `get_prompt` (`prompts/get`). Each connects, runs the `initialize` handshake, sends the
    call, and returns an `InvocationResult` carrying `latency_ms` (the connect→response round trip,
    session teardown excluded).
  - **Three outcomes are drawn distinctly** per the MCP tools spec: a tool that runs and succeeds
    (`completed=True`, `is_error=False`, content returned); a tool that runs but reports a
    tool-level error (`isError:true` → `completed=True`, `is_error=True`, error content still
    returned — *not* a transport failure); and a failed call (a top-level JSON-RPC protocol error
    **or** a transport/handshake failure → `completed=False` with a classified `DiscoveryError`,
    reusing the discovery taxonomy so `jsonrpc_error` vs `auth_required` vs `timeout` … is named,
    not collapsed).
  - The service never raises for an expected remote failure (every path returns a latency-bearing
    result); it raises only `ValueError` for a caller error (empty name, non-mapping arguments).
    An `INVOCATION_METHODS` registry maps the catalog `item_type` to its method so the test-harness
    route (MCAT-8.2) can dispatch from a stored capability kind. No schema changes.
  - Tests: unit coverage over a mocked httpx transport (the three outcomes, structured content,
    `resources/read`/`prompts/get`, argument guards, `as_dict` shaping) plus an integration test
    that calls a real loopback stub server end to end. Bump objectified-rest 1.19.0 → 1.20.0;
    ROADMAP updated.

## [1.18.0] - 2026-06-27

### Added
- **MCP scoring, grading & fingerprint persistence (#3685, V2-MCP-21.4 / MCAT-7.4)** — the
  deterministic MCP lint findings (MCAT-7.1…7.3) now roll up into a stored quality score per
  discovered version:
  - New `app/mcp_score.py`: `score_mcp_surface(surface)` consumes the findings from
    `mcp_lint.lint_mcp_surface` and returns an `MCPScoreResult` with a weighted **0-100 score**
    (100 minus capped per-rule severity penalties, so a MUST/`error` failure is weighted heavier
    than a SHOULD/`warning`, which outweighs an `info` advisory), an **A-F grade** from the V124
    house bands (A≥90 … F<60 — the same thresholds the OpenAPI lint score uses), per-rule and
    per-severity tallies, and a stable **report fingerprint** for staleness detection. Pure and
    deterministic: the same surface always yields the same score, grade, and fingerprint.
  - New DB helper `Database.set_mcp_version_score` upserts the score into `odb.mcp_version_scores`
    (one row per version; a re-score overwrites the row and moves `scored_at`), mirroring the
    per-revision `set_version_quality_score`. The table already existed from V130 — no migration.
  - The score is **auto-captured at version creation**: when discovery records a new
    `mcp_endpoint_versions` snapshot, `mcp_discovery_engine._capture_mcp_version_score` lints,
    scores, and persists it best-effort — a scoring failure is logged and never breaks the
    (already committed) discovery, the MCP analogue of `_capture_version_quality_score()`.

## [1.14.0] - 2026-06-27

### Added
- **Credential REST + redaction (#3681, V2-MCP-20.5 / MCAT-6.5)** — tenants can now set, inspect
  and clear the outbound credential for one of their MCP endpoints, with secrets redacted on every
  response:
  - New tenant-scoped routes under `/v1/mcp/{tenant_slug}/endpoints/{id}/credentials`:
    `PUT` sets/replaces a credential, `GET` returns its **redacted** status, and `DELETE` clears it.
    Each route re-validates the endpoint against the caller's token tenant, so a cross-tenant id
    reads as `404`.
  - **Secrets are never returned.** The plaintext payload supplied on `PUT` is validated against its
    `auth_type` (reusing the MCAT-6.1 auth-type model, so a malformed or header-injecting secret is
    rejected with `422` at the boundary), sealed via the MCAT-6.2 envelope encryption, and stored as
    ciphertext. Every read projects through `mcp_credential_status_from_row`, which reports only
    `auth_type`, a `configured` flag, a fixed `masked_secret` placeholder, `key_version`, non-secret
    `oauth_metadata` and timestamps — the ciphertext and the decrypted secret have no field to escape
    through.
  - `auth_type` on `PUT` must be a secret-bearing scheme (`bearer`/`header`/`oauth2`/`env`); the
    anonymous `none` state is reached by `DELETE` (idempotent — `removed` reports whether a row was
    actually dropped). When credential encryption is not configured a `PUT` fails closed with `503`
    rather than storing an unprotected secret.
  - New DB helpers `upsert_mcp_endpoint_credentials` (one row per endpoint, bumps
    `last_refreshed_at`) and `delete_mcp_endpoint_credentials`.

## [1.13.0] - 2026-06-27

### Added
- **Encryption-at-rest for MCP credentials (#3678, V2-MCP-20.2 / MCAT-6.2)** — outbound MCP
  credentials are now sealed with AES-256-GCM **envelope encryption** before they reach
  `odb.mcp_endpoint_credentials.encrypted_payload`, so the database holds ciphertext only:
  - New `app/mcp_credential_crypto.py`: a per-secret random data-encryption key (DEK) encrypts the
    JSON payload and is itself wrapped by an environment-supplied master key. `seal_credential_payload`
    returns `(ciphertext, key_version)`; `unseal_credential_payload` decrypts in-memory at connect
    time and is fail-safe (returns `None` for a tampered/foreign/wrong-version blob or a missing key).
  - **Key rotation** via the `key_version` column: several master keys can be configured at once
    (`OBJECTIFIED_MCP_CREDENTIAL_ENCRYPTION_KEYS`, a JSON version→key map) with a selectable active
    version (`OBJECTIFIED_MCP_CREDENTIAL_ACTIVE_KEY_VERSION`); old rows stay decryptable while new
    secrets seal under the active key, and `reseal_credential_payload` migrates a row onto it. The
    key-version is bound into the GCM AAD so a row cannot be silently re-pointed at another key.
  - The MCAT-6.1 `decrypt_credential_payload` seam in `app/mcp_credentials.py` is now wired to this
    module; misconfigured keys fail fast at startup (`validate_credential_encryption_keys`). Secrets
    never appear in logs or error messages.

## [1.8.6] - 2026-06-27

### Added
- **Change-report & compare API (#3672, V2-MCP-18.5 / MCAT-4.5)** — four tenant-scoped read
  surfaces over an endpoint's discovery version history, so a UI/CLI can render the timeline,
  inspect any snapshot, and diff any two versions:
  - `GET /v1/mcp/{tenant_slug}/endpoints/{id}/versions` — version history **newest-first**,
    each row carrying `version_seq`, the human-readable date/time `version_tag`, the quality
    `score`/`grade` (when scored), the per-direction `change_counts` it introduced, and an
    `is_current` flag.
  - `GET …/versions/{vid}` — one version's **full surface**: server identity, declared
    `capabilities`, `instructions`, score, change counts, and every normalized capability item.
  - `GET …/versions/{vid}/changes` — the stored `previous → this` diff (empty for the first
    version), in the same stable order an on-demand compare produces.
  - `GET …/versions/compare?base={vid}&target={vid}` — an **on-demand structured diff between
    any two versions** (adjacent or not), computed by the canonical surface diff engine
    (`diff_surfaces`, #3669). The order is normalized older→newer so `added`/`removed` read in
    the natural direction; the same version on both sides yields an empty diff with
    `fingerprint_changed = false`; the result carries `counts` and the `added`/`removed`/
    `modified` `changes`.

  Every route re-validates the endpoint against the caller's **token tenant** (the URL slug is
  informational), and the version reads are scoped to that endpoint, so a cross-tenant or
  cross-endpoint id reads as `404`. New Pydantic models (`McpEndpointVersionSummary`,
  `McpEndpointVersionDetail`, `McpCapabilityItemOut`, `McpVersionChangeOut`,
  `McpVersionCompareResponse`, …) and DB readers (`list_mcp_endpoint_versions`,
  `get_mcp_endpoint_version`, `get_mcp_version_changes`) back the routes; the surface
  reconstruction helper shared with version-creation is now the public
  `reconstruct_surface`, and `compare_endpoint_versions` powers the compare route.

## [1.8.4] - 2026-06-26

### Changed
- **Version creation on change — canonical diff wiring (#3670, V2-MCP-18.3 / MCAT-4.3)** — the
  discovery persistence step (`app.mcp_discovery_engine`) now computes the `previous → new`
  change set with the canonical surface diff engine (`diff_surfaces`, #3669) instead of the
  legacy inline raw-entry diff. On re-discovery, an unchanged `surface_fingerprint` still
  creates **no** new version (only `last_discovered_at` is stamped, so a stable server never
  spams the history); a changed fingerprint inserts exactly one new version
  (`version_seq+1`) with its capability items and the diff persisted as `mcp_version_changes`
  rows, and advances `mcp_endpoints.current_version_id` — all in one transaction. Because the
  diff now runs over each surface's *semantic projection* (the same fields that feed the
  fingerprint), it is in lock-step with change detection — volatile/vendor fields never
  produce phantom change rows — and it records **server-metadata** changes (server
  version/title/name, protocol version, instructions, capabilities) that the prior
  capability-only raw diff missed, with per-field before/after detail. The first version
  emits one `added` row per capability and suppresses synthetic "changed from null"
  server-metadata rows. The previous snapshot is reconstructed from its stored rows via
  `DiscoverySurface.from_rows`, so version-creation and the on-demand compare API (MCAT-4.5)
  share a single diff implementation. `compute_version_changes` is replaced by
  `compute_version_change_rows`.

## [1.8.3] - 2026-06-26

### Added
- **MCP surface diff engine (#3669, V2-MCP-18.2 / MCAT-4.2)** — a pure
  `app.mcp_client.diff.diff_surfaces(base, target)` that compares **any two** normalized
  `DiscoverySurface` objects and returns a structured `SurfaceDiff`: every capability item
  (tool/resource/resource_template/prompt) **added**, **removed**, or **modified**, plus
  server-metadata changes (`protocol_version`, `server_name/title/version`, `instructions`,
  `capabilities`). Items are keyed by `(item_type, name)`, so a rename reads as remove + add and
  an in-place edit reads as a single modify carrying a per-field `FieldChange` breakdown
  (`description`, `inputSchema`/`outputSchema`, `annotations`, prompt `arguments`, resource
  `uri`/`mimeType`, …) with before/after detail. The comparison runs over each surface's *semantic
  projection* — exactly the fields that feed the surface fingerprint (#3668) — so volatile/vendor
  fields (the reserved `_meta` block, a resource `size` hint, unknown extension keys) never produce
  phantom changes and identical surfaces yield an empty diff with `fingerprint_unchanged` true.
  Output is deterministic (changes ordered server-first, then by kind and name) and maps one-to-one
  onto `mcp_version_changes` rows via `SurfaceDiff.to_change_rows(version_id)`, with `counts`
  aggregating added/removed/modified. Diffing arbitrary versions directly (not chaining adjacent
  step-diffs) keeps non-adjacent `vX → vY` comparisons exact. Feeds version-creation (MCAT-4.3) and
  the on-demand compare API (MCAT-4.5). New module `src/app/mcp_client/diff.py`; new tests
  `tests/test_mcp_diff.py`.

## [1.8.2] - 2026-06-26

### Changed
- **Canonical surface fingerprint — semantic projection (#3668, V2-MCP-18.1 / MCAT-4.1)** — the MCP
  `surface_fingerprint` (`DiscoverySurface.fingerprint`) is now computed over a documented *semantic
  projection* of the surface rather than the verbatim wire entries. Only the fields that define the
  server's offering feed the hash: per item, the allow-list in `FINGERPRINT_FIELDS` (tool
  name/title/description/inputSchema/outputSchema/annotations; resource & template
  name/title/description/uri(or uriTemplate)/mimeType/annotations; prompt name/title/description/
  arguments) and, at the surface level, `protocolVersion`, `serverInfo` (name/title/version),
  `capabilities`, and `instructions`. Volatile and vendor-specific data is excluded so it can never
  flip the fingerprint: the reserved `_meta` block is stripped *recursively* at every depth (including
  inside `inputSchema`, prompt `arguments`, and `capabilities`), and a resource's volatile `size` hint
  and any unknown extension keys fall outside the allow-list. Result: an identical offering yields an
  identical fingerprint across runs and hosts, while a single semantically meaningful change (e.g. a
  tool description edit) flips it. The verbatim wire entry is still retained per item (`raw`) for
  storage/round-trip; only the fingerprint narrows to the semantic fields. No DB or API surface change.

## [1.8.1] - 2026-06-26

### Added
- **MCP endpoint lifecycle — delete (#3667, V2-MCP-17.5 / MCAT-3.5)** — endpoints can now be retired
  via `DELETE /v1/mcp/{tenant_slug}/endpoints/{id}`. The endpoint row is *soft* deleted (stamped
  `deleted_at`, flipped to `enabled = false`, `current_version_id` cleared) so it disappears from
  browse/list/get and is skipped by the discovery sweep, while its slug stays reserved against the
  `(tenant_id, slug)` unique constraint. Its child data is *hard* deleted in the same tenant-scoped
  transaction: the credential vault row (the security-critical purge), every discovery job, and every
  version snapshot — whose capability items, change logs and scores cascade away via the
  `ON DELETE CASCADE` chain off `mcp_endpoint_versions`. The route returns a teardown summary
  (`credentials_purged`, `versions_deleted`, `jobs_deleted`) and `404` when the endpoint is not the
  caller's tenant's (or was already deleted). New `database.py` method `soft_delete_mcp_endpoint`, new
  `models.py` response model `McpEndpointDeleteResponse`; covered by route and DB-layer unit tests in
  `tests/test_mcp_catalog_routes.py`. (Enable/disable already shipped in #3663 via the `enabled` PATCH
  field, so this completes the enable/disable/delete lifecycle.)

## [1.6.6] - 2026-06-26

### Added
- **MCP catalog endpoint CRUD (#3663, V2-MCP-17.1 / MCAT-3.1)** — tenants can now register and manage
  external MCP servers in a catalog. New `app/mcp_catalog_routes.py` exposes the `mcp_endpoints_router`
  (registered in `main.py`) with tenant-scoped CRUD over `odb.mcp_endpoints`:
  `POST /v1/mcp/{tenant_slug}/endpoints` (register), `GET …/endpoints` (list),
  `GET …/endpoints/{id}` (fetch), and `PATCH …/endpoints/{id}` (partial update). Tenant scoping comes
  from the existing `validate_authentication` dependency (JWT Bearer or `X-API-Key`): every query is
  scoped to the caller's `tenant_id` — never the URL slug — so a cross-tenant id reads as `404`. The
  catalog `slug` is auto-derived from the endpoint name (or an explicit `slug` override) and made
  unique within the tenant by the DB layer (`base`, then `base-2`, `base-3`, …), with the
  `(tenant_id, slug)` unique constraint as a backstop that surfaces as `409`. New `database.py` methods
  `list_mcp_endpoints`, `get_mcp_endpoint`, `insert_mcp_endpoint`, `update_mcp_endpoint`, and the
  `_next_available_mcp_slug` resolver; new `models.py` request/response models
  (`McpEndpointCreate` / `McpEndpointUpdate` / `McpEndpointOut`, transport + visibility enums, positive
  cadence bound, camelCase aliases). Covered by route, model, and DB-layer unit tests in
  `tests/test_mcp_catalog_routes.py`; OpenAPI docs are generated for all four operations.

## [1.6.3] - 2026-06-26

### Added
- **MCP discovery list methods + pagination (#3659, V2-MCP-16.3)** — the capability-enumeration layer
  of the MCP discovery client (`app/mcp_client/discovery.py`), sitting on top of the `initialize`
  handshake. `discover_listings()` walks `tools/list`, `resources/list`, `resources/templates/list`
  (result key `resourceTemplates`), and `prompts/list`, returning a `DiscoveryListings` of raw items
  per category. Each endpoint is queried **only** when the server declared its owning capability in
  `initialize` (the single `resources` capability gates both resource endpoints); undeclared endpoints
  are skipped and reported in `DiscoveryListings.skipped`. The lower-level `paginate()` helper follows
  the opaque `cursor`/`nextCursor` loop to exhaustion, accumulating every page. Because the cursor is
  server-supplied, the loop is guarded against non-terminating servers two ways — a repeated cursor (a
  cycle) and exceeding `DEFAULT_PAGE_LIMIT` pages both raise `McpPaginationError`; a declared endpoint
  that returns a JSON-RPC error raises `McpDiscoveryError`. Covered by mocked-httpx unit tests plus an
  integration test that pages a real multi-page loopback stub and confirms undeclared capabilities are
  never requested.

## [1.6.2] - 2026-06-26

### Added
- **MCP initialize handshake + version negotiation (#3658, V2-MCP-16.2)** — the lifecycle layer on top
  of the Streamable HTTP transport (`app/mcp_client/handshake.py`). `initialize_session()` sends
  `initialize` with our `protocolVersion`, `capabilities`, and `clientInfo`; parses `serverInfo`,
  `capabilities`, and `instructions`; and negotiates the protocol version (echo, result-level fallback,
  `-32602` fallback-and-retry, disconnect on unsupported). The negotiated version is recorded on the
  transport (pinning `MCP-Protocol-Version` on later requests) and returned on `InitializeResult`,
  after which `notifications/initialized` completes the handshake. Covered by mocked-httpx unit tests
  plus an integration test negotiating against real loopback stub servers for both supported revisions.

## [1.6.1] - 2026-06-26

### Added
- **MCP transport client over Streamable HTTP (#3657, V2-MCP-16.1)** — the network foundation of the
  MCP discovery client (`app/mcp_client/transport_http.py`). `StreamableHttpTransport` speaks JSON-RPC
  2.0 to a single `…/mcp` endpoint per the MCP `2025-06-18` spec: every message is `POST`ed with
  `Accept: application/json, text/event-stream`, and both response shapes are handled transparently —
  a single `application/json` object or a `text/event-stream` SSE stream drained until the matching
  response id arrives (server-initiated messages on the stream are dispatched to an optional handler).
  Notifications are sent without an id and accept `202`. The server's `Mcp-Session-Id` is captured at
  `initialize` and echoed on every later request, `MCP-Protocol-Version` is pinned on all
  post-initialization requests, and the session is torn down with `DELETE` (a `405` refusal is
  tolerated). `400`/`405` surface as `McpHttpStatusError`; a `404` while a session is active surfaces
  as `McpSessionExpiredError` and clears the local session. Transport security: plaintext `http://` is
  allowed only to loopback hosts (local reference servers) unless `allow_insecure_http=True`, and an
  `Origin` header is always sent. Covered by mocked-httpx unit tests plus an integration test against a
  real loopback stub MCP server.

## [1.4.0] - 2026-06-24

### Added
- **Observability & error handling (#3617, RC1-3.2)** — production-grade diagnosability for the REST
  service. Structured JSON logging via `structlog` (`app/logging_config.py`, mirroring the MCP setup)
  emits one JSON object per line with `timestamp`, `level`, `logger`, `event` and a per-request
  `request_id` that is bound for the whole request lifetime — so every log line a handler emits is
  correlated to its request. A new `ObservabilityMiddleware` (`app/observability.py`, installed as the
  outermost layer) assigns/propagates the id via the `X-Request-ID` header (reusing an upstream value
  when present), records an in-process metrics registry (total requests, requests/sec, error rate,
  in-flight gauge, latency p50/p95/p99), and logs one access line per request.
- **Consistent error envelope** — exception handlers wrap every `4xx`/`5xx` (including
  `RequestValidationError` and the rate limiter's `429`) in a uniform shape that *preserves* FastAPI's
  `detail` for backward compatibility while adding an `error` object (`status`/`message`/`type`/
  `request_id`) and a top-level `request_id`. An unhandled-exception handler logs the full stack trace
  correlated to the request id (error tracking) and returns a safe generic 500 that never leaks
  internal details.
- **Health / readiness probes** — `GET /livez` (liveness, no DB), `GET /readyz` (readiness; `503` when
  the database is unreachable), and the backward-compatible `GET /health`. Wired into `docker-compose`
  (the `rest` healthcheck now uses `/readyz`; the `mcp` service gained a `/health` healthcheck).
- **Minimal ops dashboard** (platform-admin only) — `GET /v1/ops/metrics`, `/v1/ops/backups`,
  `/v1/ops/status`, and a dependency-free HTML `/v1/ops/dashboard`. Backup status is read from the
  RC1-1.3 backup manifests (`app/backup_status.py`): latest backup per scope, age, and a `stale` flag
  against the configured RPO window.
- New settings: `OBJECTIFIED_LOG_LEVEL`, `OBJECTIFIED_LOG_JSON`, `OBJECTIFIED_REQUEST_ID_HEADER`,
  `OBJECTIFIED_BACKUP_DIR`, `OBJECTIFIED_BACKUP_STALE_AFTER_HOURS`.

## [1.3.0] - 2026-06-23

### Added
- **Mock Server (#3615, RC1-2.2)** — provision a hosted mock from any published version and consume
  the designed API before a backend exists. New management plane `POST/GET /v1/mocks/{tenant_slug}`
  (provision, list), `GET/DELETE /v1/mocks/{tenant_slug}/{id}` (inspect, destroy), and
  `PUT .../active-scenario` (switch scenario), all tenant-scoped + authenticated. The OpenAPI
  document generated for the version (same output as `/v1/swagger/...`) is frozen into the instance,
  so the mock is stable for its lifetime. New public data plane `ANY /v1/mock/{id}/...` replays
  schema-valid responses synthesised deterministically from the response schemas
  (`app/mock_data_generator.py`, validated with `jsonschema`) and applies the selected scenario
  (`app/mock_engine.py`). Per-operation scenarios override status / latency / body and are selectable
  per instance or per request via the `X-Mock-Scenario` header; four built-ins ship (happy-path,
  server-error, not-found, slow). Free-tier guardrails: instances auto-expire (`410 Gone` past
  `expires_at`) and are rate limited per instance (`429` with `Retry-After`). Backed by migration
  V123 (`odb.mock_instances`). Configurable via `OBJECTIFIED_MOCK_SERVER_ENABLED` (default on),
  `OBJECTIFIED_MOCK_DEFAULT_TTL_HOURS` (default 24), `OBJECTIFIED_MOCK_MAX_TTL_HOURS` (default 168),
  and `OBJECTIFIED_MOCK_RATE_LIMIT_PER_MINUTE` (default 60).

## [1.2.0] - 2026-06-23

### Added
- **SSRF guard for user-supplied URL fetches (#3612)** — a new `app/ssrf_guard.py` vets every URL
  the import-from-URL and public repository-registration paths fetch: http/https only, no embedded
  credentials, and DNS resolution with rejection of any non-public address (loopback, RFC1918,
  link-local incl. the `169.254.169.254` metadata IP, multicast, reserved, unspecified — IPv4 and
  IPv6 including IPv4-mapped). Installed as an httpx request event hook so each redirect hop is
  re-validated, closing redirect-based bypasses. Applied to `import_ingestion._fetch_url_text`, the
  generic-URL branch of `repository_validation.validate_public_clone_url`, and the GitLab branch
  (whose API origin is derived from the tenant-supplied host). Set
  `OBJECTIFIED_SSRF_ALLOW_PRIVATE=true` to disable IP filtering for local development.
- **Per-tenant rate limiting (#3612)** — a new `app/rate_limit.py` middleware buckets requests by
  API key (hashed) → tenant slug (from the path) → client IP, enforcing a configurable fixed window.
  Authenticated traffic uses the higher limit, public traffic the lower; over-limit requests get
  `429` with `Retry-After`, and every response carries `X-RateLimit-{Limit,Remaining,Reset}`.
  Configurable via `OBJECTIFIED_RATE_LIMIT_ENABLED` (default on),
  `OBJECTIFIED_RATE_LIMIT_AUTHENTICATED_PER_MINUTE` (default 600),
  `OBJECTIFIED_RATE_LIMIT_PUBLIC_PER_MINUTE` (default 120), and
  `OBJECTIFIED_RATE_LIMIT_WINDOW_SECONDS` (default 60). `/health` and the docs are exempt. Limits
  are per replica (in-process counter); a shared store is the path to multi-replica enforcement.

### Fixed
- **GitLab clone-URL SSRF + crash (#3612)** — `parse_gitlab_project_path` built its API origin from
  `urlparse(...).host` (nonexistent attribute; raised `AttributeError`) and the GitLab branch
  fetched the tenant-controlled host with an unguarded client. Now reconstructs the origin from
  `hostname`/`port` and routes the fetch through the SSRF guard.

## [1.0.26] - 2026-06-23

### Added
- **Registry coverage/stats endpoint (#3454)** — `GET /v1/types/{tenant_slug}/stats` returns the
  tenant's registry coverage KPIs as a single server-side aggregate: core type count, tenant type
  count, imported count, properties bound, bound class count, unresolved `$ref` count, and
  namespace count. Backed by `Database.get_registry_coverage_stats(tenant_id)`, which aggregates
  over the extended `odb.primitives` table (type/namespace/import counts and unresolved `refs`
  edges) and the tenant's `odb.class_properties` bindings on the existing `objectified-db`
  connection — replacing the client-side stat computation in the Primitives overview dashboard
  (#3467). Gated by the `require_primitives_registry` entitlement and tenant-scoped to the
  authenticated caller. (The endpoint, model, and DB aggregate first shipped alongside #3467; this
  release documents and formally closes #3454.)

## [1.0.23] - 2026-06-23

### Added
- **Primitives type-registry entitlement & feature gating (#3478)** — the advanced Type Registry
  surface can now be gated behind a per-tenant `primitives-registry` entitlement. A reusable
  `require_primitives_registry` dependency (`app/feature_gating.py`) guards every `/v1/types/*`
  route (resolver, namespaces, settings, stats) plus the `/v1/primitives/*` import pipeline
  (`/import`, `/import/review`, `/import/stage`, `/imports`, `/imports/{id}`) and the `/unresolved`
  resolver. Baseline primitives CRUD (list/get/create/update/delete) and `/health` are never gated.
- **`Database.tenant_has_feature_flag(tenant_id, user_id, flag_name)`** — resolves a named feature
  flag for a tenant/user with precedence per-user override → per-tenant override → license default,
  honoring the flag's global master switch (`odb.feature_flags.enabled`).

### Changed
- **`OBJECTIFIED_PRIMITIVES_REGISTRY_GATING` operator switch (default off)** — when off, the gate is
  a pass-through and behavior is unchanged (every authenticated tenant reaches the advanced routes);
  when on, non-entitled tenants receive `403`. The `primitives-registry` flag is seeded by
  objectified-db migration `20260623-130000.sql` (bundled into the Paid and Sponsor plans, not Free)
  and is managed through the existing admin Feature-Flag panel.

## [1.0.20] - 2026-06-22

### Added
- **Import review: conflicts, dedupe, validation report (#3464)** — the Primitives import path no
  longer skips duplicates silently. New `app/primitives_review.py` provides the pure review logic:
  each imported definition is classified against the registry as **New** (nothing shares its `$id`),
  **Identical** (an existing type has the same `$id` and an identical schema), or **Conflict** (same
  `$id`, different schema), and a caller's per-type resolution choice (**keep** / **overwrite** /
  **rename**) is turned into a concrete commit decision by `decide()`.
- **`POST /v1/primitives/{tenant_slug}/import/review`** — a dry-run that writes nothing and returns
  the classification, a draft 2020-12 validation report, the `$ref` rewrites, the unresolved-ref
  mapping, and the resolution choices each conflict offers. This is the report the import wizard
  (#3469) renders before commit; the same classification drives the commit, so the committed result
  matches the review.

### Changed
- **`POST /v1/primitives/{tenant_slug}/import`** now honors review choices. New request fields:
  `dedupe` (default `true` — an Identical definition is skipped as a duplicate) and `resolutions`
  (a `name -> {action, new_name}` map). On commit, a conflict resolved `overwrite` updates the
  existing row in place, `rename` creates a copy under a new (slugified) name, and the default
  `keep` leaves the existing type but **surfaces** the conflict instead of dropping it. The import
  report gains `overwritten` / `renamed` / `identical` buckets (and their totals) plus a per-type
  `reviews` list, so the report can be shown to match the outcome; provenance counts reflect rows
  written (created + overwritten + renamed) vs. passed over (deduped + kept).
- Regenerated `openapi.{json,yaml}` for the new endpoint, request fields, and `ImportResolution`
  model; bumped to 1.0.20 (npm) / 1.0.90 (py).

## [1.0.19] - 2026-06-22

### Added
- **`$ref` rewrite + namespace/scope mapping (#3463)** — imported definitions now have their refs
  rewritten for their committed place in the registry instead of carrying document-local pointers.
  New `app/primitives_rewrite.py` provides `rewrite_import_schema()`, which (1) rewrites every
  intra-source pointer (`#/$defs/Money`, `#/definitions/Money`, `#/types/Money`) to a relative
  registry ref at the sibling's committed `$id` (`./money`, matching the `$id` leaf-slug; a deeper
  pointer like `#/$defs/Money/properties/c` is preserved as `./money#/properties/c`), and (2) maps a
  recognized string `format` (`email`, `uuid`, `uri`, `date`, `date-time`, `time`) to its seeded
  `std/v0/types` core type by injecting a relative `$ref` (mirroring the seed's
  `{"$ref": "../primitives/string", "format": "email"}` shape; an author's explicit `$ref` is never
  overridden). Because both rewrites produce ordinary registry-relative `$ref` values, the existing
  resolver (#3456) turns them into persisted `refs` edges with no separate internal-edge bookkeeping
  — so imported refs are stored relative and resolve via Epic 3, and core-format mapping resolves to
  the core type. `POST /v1/primitives/{tenant_slug}/import` applies this on commit for both the JSON
  Schema and type-def-bundle paths; a new `map_core_formats` request flag (default `true`) toggles
  the format mapping, and the import report gains a per-type `rewrites` map for the review table.

### Changed
- **Import commit no longer persists `internal` ref edges (#3463).** The `$defs`/`types` sibling
  pointers that #3461/#3462 captured as `{status: "internal"}` edges are now rewritten to relative
  registry refs and resolved like any other edge, so a committed primitive's `refs` carries only
  `resolved`/`unresolved` edges. (The staging path's per-candidate `internal_refs` metadata is
  unchanged.)

## [1.0.18] - 2026-06-22

### Added
- **Type-definition bundle importer (#3462)** — the `type-def-bundle` source kind now expands into
  many interlinked primitives instead of being enumerated shallowly. New `app/primitives_bundle.py`
  provides `parse_type_def_bundle()` (a parsed `.json`/`.yaml` bundle → discrete types) and
  `expand_zip_bundle()` (a `.zip` archive whose JSON/YAML members are each one type → a merged bundle
  document). A bundle reads its types from a `types` container (`$defs`/`definitions` accepted as
  equivalents); each type captures its **inter-type** `$ref` edges — refs at a sibling bundle type
  (`#/types/Money`, `#/$defs/Money`, `#/definitions/Money`) — as `internal` edges in the `refs` JSONB
  column for the rewrite stage (#3463), and is validated against draft 2020-12. The staging pipeline
  (`POST /import/stage`) now deep-parses bundle candidates (internal refs + per-type validation,
  matching the JSON Schema path), and `POST /v1/primitives/{tenant_slug}/import` with
  `source_kind='type-def-bundle'` commits a bundle of N types as N `odb.primitives` rows with their
  refs intact. A malformed bundle (no recognizable container, no usable types, bad/oversized/duplicate
  zip members) is rejected with a clear 400 / `BundleError` message. The per-definition commit loop is
  shared by the JSON Schema and bundle paths via `_commit_imported_definitions()`.

## [1.0.16] - 2026-06-22

### Added
- **Import pipeline core + ingestion (#3460)** — new `POST /v1/primitives/{tenant_slug}/import/stage`,
  the single orchestration path for all import sources. It ingests a document by one of four
  methods — `paste` / `file` (inline text), `url` (http/https fetch), or `git` (a file from a public
  github.com repo, reusing the repository-scan fetcher) — parses it as JSON **or** YAML, and detects
  the candidate types it carries, dispatched on source kind: `$defs`/`definitions` for `json-schema`
  (a bare document is one candidate), the `types`/`$defs` container for `type-def-bundle`, and
  `components.schemas` for `openapi`. The result is *staged*, not committed — each candidate carries
  its JSON Pointer and `$ref` count for the downstream parse (#3461/#3462), `$ref` rewrite (#3463),
  and conflict review (#3464) stages. Every staged import records an auditable `staged`
  `odb.primitive_imports` row (reusing #3448; no new table). The legacy paste-and-commit
  `POST /v1/primitives/{tenant_slug}/import` is unchanged. New `app/import_ingestion.py` (per-method
  fetch + JSON/YAML parse), `app/import_pipeline.py` (pure detection + staging), and
  `PrimitiveImportStageRequest` / `PrimitiveImportStageResult` / `StagedTypeCandidate` /
  `GitSourceLocator` models.

## [1.0.13] - 2026-06-22

### Added
- **Resolver API + dependency listing (#3459)** — new `POST /v1/types/{tenant_slug}/resolve`
  re-resolves every `$ref` dependency edge across the tenant's primitives against the *current*
  registry state and returns the per-primitive dependency listing the resolver UI (#3470) and
  Designer consume. Each stored edge's `resolved`/`unresolved` status is recomputed with the same
  existence test as save-time resolution (#3456) — so a target created since the edge was last
  computed now resolves and a deleted one now dangles — and the refreshed edges are persisted for
  the tenant's own primitives whose status changed ("re-resolve updates statuses"). Each resolved
  edge is enriched with its dependency target's id and name so the response is the dependency
  graph. The top-level counts mirror the coverage KPIs of `GET …/unresolved` (#3457/#3454), plus
  `reresolved_primitive_count` for how many primitives this pass updated. New `ResolveResponse` /
  `ResolvedPrimitiveRefs` / `ResolvedRefEdge` models and `app/type_resolver.py` (pure edge
  re-evaluation + dependency enrichment); system-core rows are listed but never written back.

## [1.0.12] - 2026-06-22

### Added
- **Unresolved-reference detection, flags & counts (#3457)** — a primitive's relative `$ref`
  edges are resolved and flagged `resolved`/`unresolved` on save/import (#3456); this adds the
  detection surface and the re-resolve-clears behavior on top of it. New
  `GET /v1/primitives/{tenant_slug}/unresolved` returns the tenant's total unresolved-edge count,
  the number of affected primitives, and a per-primitive breakdown (each with only its unresolved
  edges) — feeding the registry coverage/stats KPIs (#3454) and the resolver UI (#3470). New
  `UnresolvedRefsResponse`/`UnresolvedRefPrimitive` models and DB aggregates
  `count_unresolved_refs` / `get_primitives_with_unresolved_refs` (scoped to the caller's tenant,
  aggregating over the `odb.primitives.refs` JSONB column). Creating, importing, or repinning a
  primitive now runs a best-effort reconcile (`mark_refs_resolved_to_target`) that clears the
  unresolved flag on the tenant's other primitives whose dangling edge pointed at the new type's
  `$id`, so "fixing the target clears on re-resolve" without re-saving each dependent by hand.

## [1.0.11] - 2026-06-22

### Added
- **Type definition draft 2020-12 validation (#3452)** — the Primitives create, update, and
  import endpoints now strictly validate the supplied `schema` against the JSON Schema
  **draft 2020-12 meta-schema** server-side (new `app/schema_validation.py`, backed by the
  `jsonschema` library). An invalid schema is rejected at the REST boundary with HTTP 422 and a
  structured, field-level `errors` list (`path` / `message` / `keyword`) instead of being
  persisted. Valid types persist with a stable, derived JSON Schema `$id` (the
  `odb.primitives.schema_id` column) — an author-declared `$id` is honored, otherwise it is
  computed from the namespace base URI (or a stable tenant-default base) plus a url-safe slug of
  the name — and a stamped `draft` (default `2020-12`, read from `$schema`). The stored schema
  document is stamped with its `$id`/`$schema` so it is self-describing. `PrimitiveCreateRequest`/
  `PrimitiveUpdateRequest` gained optional `namespace`/`base_uri` placement fields (and `enabled`
  on update); `PrimitiveSchema` now exposes `schema_id`/`draft`/`namespace`/`base_uri`. The import
  path runs the same validator per `$defs` definition, recording invalid definitions in the import
  report (`error: "invalid_schema"` with `details`) without blocking the valid ones.

## [1.0.10] - 2026-06-22

### Added
- **Namespace CRUD API (#3451)** — added the type-registry namespace endpoints
  `GET/POST/PUT /v1/types/{tenant_slug}/namespaces` over the existing `objectified-db`
  connection. Namespaces (scope, base URI, version root, visibility, default) are persisted in
  the new `odb.type_namespaces` table, whose `namespace`/`base_uri` columns mirror those on
  `odb.primitives` (the type-count join key). `GET` lists system-core (`std/*`) namespaces plus
  the caller tenant's own, each with its tenant-scoped type count. `POST`/`PUT` require a tenant
  administrator and operate on tenant-owned namespaces only; the namespace path is immutable, and
  base URI / version root are derived from the path when omitted. System-core namespaces are
  platform-governed and read-only via the API (no platform-admin role is exposed), so creating or
  modifying one returns 403. Backed by `TypeNamespaceSchema`/`TypeNamespaceCreateRequest`/
  `TypeNamespaceUpdateRequest` models and `Database.list/get/create/update_type_namespace()` DAOs.

## [1.0.9] - 2026-06-22

### Added
- **Type-registry service skeleton + health (#3450)** — added an anonymous
  registry-layer health/ping endpoint `GET /v1/primitives/health` that reports the
  `objectified-db` connection status backing the registry's `odb.primitives` storage
  (overall `status`, `connection`, and whether the storage table is present). The existing
  tenant-scoped primitive CRUD/import endpoints are unchanged and remain authenticated, so
  current clients are unaffected. Backed by a new `Database.registry_ping()` probe and a
  `RegistryHealthResponse` model.

## [1.0.8] - 2026-06-22

### Added
- **Primitive import provenance & property binding (#3448)** — every
  `POST /v1/primitives/{tenant}/import` now records an auditable provenance row in the new
  `odb.primitive_imports` table (source kind, options, and a JSON outcome report with
  imported/skipped/errors) and marks imported primitives `source='imported'`. New read
  endpoints `GET /v1/primitives/{tenant}/imports` and `GET /v1/primitives/{tenant}/imports/{id}`
  expose the history and its report. Class properties gained a `primitive_id` foreign key to
  `odb.primitives` plus a stored `primitive_ref`, surfaced on the Designer read path so a bound
  property reloads its `$ref`; bindings are carried through class and version copies.

## [1.0.7] - 2026-06-22

### Removed
- **Separate type-registry database (#3447)** — removed the separate type-registry database
  and its dedicated REST connection, configuration, and health reporting. The type registry
  now lives in the main `objectified-db` database; `GET /health` reports only the core
  database status again. Reverses #3446.
