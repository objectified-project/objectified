"""Golden-path UI <-> REST contract: the REST side (RC1-3.1, #3616).

The product's golden path (``docs/GOLDEN_PATH.md``) depends on a small, stable set of REST operations.
This test asserts every operation in the shared contract (``scripts/golden_path/contract.json``) is
present in the live REST OpenAPI surface with the expected HTTP method. If a router is renamed, moved,
or has its method changed, this goes red — which is exactly the regression signal RC1-3.1 wants the CI
gate to carry. The matching UI-side check lives in
``objectified-ui/tests/contract/rest-golden-path-contract.test.ts``.
