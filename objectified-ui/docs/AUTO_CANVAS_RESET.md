# Auto-Reset to Canvas View - Implementation

## Feature
Automatically reset the view mode to "Canvas" when the user changes the selected project or version in the Studio page.

## Problem Solved
Previously, if a user was viewing the OpenAPI or Mermaid diagram and then switched to a different project or version, they would stay in that view mode. This could be confusing because:
- The new project/version might have different classes and structure
- Users typically want to see the canvas view first when switching contexts
- It provides a more predictable and consistent user experience

## Implementation

### Files Changed
**File**: `/Users/kenji/Development/objectified/objectified-ui/src/app/ade/studio/page.tsx`

### Changes Made

#### 1. Project Change Handler
```typescript
const handleProjectChange = (e: React.ChangeEvent<HTMLSelectElement>) => {
  setSelectedProjectId(e.target.value);
  setSelectedVersionId(''); // Reset version when project changes
  setIsReadOnly(false); // Reset read-only flag when version is cleared
  setViewMode('canvas'); // ← NEW: Reset view to canvas when project changes
};
```

#### 2. Version Change Handler
```typescript
const handleVersionChange = (e: React.ChangeEvent<HTMLSelectElement>) => {
  const versionId = e.target.value;
  setSelectedVersionId(versionId);

  // Update read-only status based on whether version is published
  const version = versions.find(v => v.id === versionId);
  setIsReadOnly(version?.published || false);
  
  // ← NEW: Reset view to canvas when version changes
  setViewMode('canvas');
};
```

## User Experience Flow

### Before
1. User is viewing Mermaid diagram for Project A, Version 1.0
2. User switches to Project B
3. **Still shows Mermaid view** (potentially confusing)
4. User has to manually click "Canvas" tab

### After
1. User is viewing Mermaid diagram for Project A, Version 1.0
2. User switches to Project B
3. **Automatically switches to Canvas view** (consistent, predictable)
4. User can see the class structure immediately

## Benefits

✅ **Consistent Behavior**: Every project/version switch shows the canvas first  
✅ **Better UX**: Users see the structure before exploring other views  
✅ **Predictable**: Users know what to expect when switching contexts  
✅ **Less Confusion**: No risk of viewing outdated diagram content  
✅ **Natural Flow**: Canvas → OpenAPI/Mermaid is the typical workflow  

## Testing

To verify the feature works:

1. Open Studio page
2. Select a project and version
3. Switch to OpenAPI or Mermaid tab
4. Change to a different project → Should auto-switch to Canvas
5. Switch back to OpenAPI or Mermaid tab
6. Change to a different version → Should auto-switch to Canvas

## Edge Cases Handled

- ✅ Switching from any view mode (Canvas, OpenAPI, Mermaid)
- ✅ Works for both project changes and version changes
- ✅ Maintains other state like read-only status correctly
- ✅ No impact on other functionality

## Documentation

Updated in `WHATS_NEW.md`:
- Added bullet point under "Modified canvas layout to improve visibility and usability"
- "Automatically returns to canvas view when changing projects or versions"
