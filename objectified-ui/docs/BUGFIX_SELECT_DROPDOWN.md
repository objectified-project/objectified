# Bug Fix: Select Dropdown Not Showing

## Issue
When clicking the "Target Project" dropdown in Step 3 (Preview), the dropdown menu was not appearing.

## Date
December 22, 2024

## Root Cause
The Select dropdown was being clipped by the parent Dialog component which has `overflow-hidden` on the DialogContent. Even though Radix UI Select uses a Portal to render outside the React tree, it needs explicit configuration to render to the document body to bypass clipping containers.

## Solution
Enhanced the Select.Portal configuration with three key changes:

### 1. Added container prop to Portal
```typescript
<Select.Portal container={typeof document !== 'undefined' ? document.body : undefined}>
```
This ensures the dropdown renders directly to `document.body`, completely bypassing the Dialog's clipping context.

### 2. Enhanced Select.Content positioning
```typescript
<Select.Content 
  className="..."
  position="popper"      // Use popper positioning strategy
  sideOffset={5}         // 5px offset from trigger
  style={{ zIndex: 9999 }} // Very high z-index
>
```

**Changes:**
- `position="popper"` - Uses better positioning algorithm
- `sideOffset={5}` - Adds 5px spacing from the trigger
- `style={{ zIndex: 9999 }}` - Ensures dropdown appears above everything

### 3. Added focus ring to trigger
```typescript
<Select.Trigger className="... focus:outline-none focus:ring-2 focus:ring-indigo-500">
```
Improves accessibility and visual feedback when dropdown is opened.

## Technical Details

### Why overflow-hidden caused the issue:
The ImportDialog has this structure:
```typescript
<DialogContent className="... overflow-hidden ...">
  <div className="overflow-y-auto ...">
    <PreviewPanel>
      <Select.Portal>  // This was being clipped
        <Select.Content> // Dropdown content
```

Even though Portal renders outside the React tree, CSS clipping still affects absolutely positioned elements if they're in the visual hierarchy.

### Why the fix works:
By explicitly setting `container={document.body}`, the Portal renders the dropdown as a direct child of `<body>`, completely outside any clipping contexts:

```html
<body>
  <div id="root">
    <Dialog>...</Dialog>
  </div>
  <!-- Dropdown renders here, outside Dialog -->
  <div data-radix-portal>
    <Select.Content>...</Select.Content>
  </div>
</body>
```

### SSR Safety:
The `typeof document !== 'undefined'` check ensures the code works during server-side rendering (Next.js) where `document` is not available.

## Files Modified
- `/Users/kenji/Development/objectified/objectified-ui/src/app/components/ade/dashboard/PreviewPanel.tsx`

## Changes Applied
1. **Line ~273**: Added `container` prop to `Select.Portal`
2. **Line ~274-279**: Enhanced `Select.Content` with positioning props
3. **Line ~271**: Added focus ring styles to `Select.Trigger`

## Testing
After this fix:
1. ✅ Click "Target Project" dropdown
2. ✅ Dropdown menu appears below the trigger
3. ✅ Two options visible:
   - "+ Create New Project"
   - "Import to Existing Project"
4. ✅ Dropdown positioned correctly with 5px offset
5. ✅ Clicking an option selects it and closes dropdown
6. ✅ Dropdown has high z-index, appears above all content
7. ✅ Works in both light and dark mode
8. ✅ Focus ring appears when trigger is focused

## Related Components

### Other Radix UI Components Used:
- **Checkbox**: Works fine (no portal needed, rendered inline)
- **Progress**: Works fine (rendered inline in AnalysisPanel)
- **Dialog**: Parent component (the clipping culprit)

### Future Considerations:
If we add more Select dropdowns in other parts of the import flow:
- Use the same Portal container pattern
- Use `position="popper"` for better positioning
- Use high z-index (9999) to avoid stacking issues
- Always add `sideOffset` for visual spacing

## Additional Notes

### Alternative Solutions Considered:
1. **Remove overflow-hidden from Dialog** ❌
   - Would break dialog scrolling behavior
   - Could cause layout issues

2. **Use different positioning strategy** ❌
   - "item-aligned" doesn't work well with clipping
   - "popper" is the best choice

3. **Increase z-index only** ❌
   - Doesn't solve clipping, only stacking
   - Still would be clipped by overflow-hidden

4. **Portal to document.body** ✅
   - Clean solution
   - Works with all browsers
   - Radix UI recommended approach
