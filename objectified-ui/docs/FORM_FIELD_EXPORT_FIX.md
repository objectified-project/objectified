# FormField and RadioGroup Export Error - FIXED ✅

## Date: December 18, 2025

## Problem
```
Export FormField doesn't exist in target module
The export FormField was not found in module [project]/objectified-ui/src/app/components/ui/FormField.tsx
The module has no exports at all.
```

Similar error for RadioGroup.tsx

## Root Cause
The FormField.tsx and RadioGroup.tsx files were empty - they had no content, despite earlier attempts to add code to them.

## Solution

Created both component files with proper React component implementations:

### FormField Component (/src/app/components/ui/FormField.tsx)
- React component for form field wrapper
- Supports: label, helperText, error, required props
- Properly exports `FormField` and `FormFieldProps`
- Includes 'use client' directive
- Uses Tailwind for styling
- Full TypeScript support

### RadioGroup Component (/src/app/components/ui/RadioGroup.tsx)
- React component for radio button groups
- Exports: `RadioGroup`, `RadioGroupItem`, `RadioGroupProps`, `RadioGroupItemProps`
- Properly handles value state and change callbacks
- Includes 'use client' directive  
- Uses Tailwind for styling
- Full TypeScript support with proper typing

## Files Created/Fixed

1. ✅ `/src/app/components/ui/FormField.tsx` - 38 lines
2. ✅ `/src/app/components/ui/RadioGroup.tsx` - 67 lines
3. ✅ `/src/app/components/ui/index.ts` - Already had exports (no change needed)

## Verification

- ✅ Files compile without errors
- ✅ No TypeScript errors in FormField.tsx
- ✅ No TypeScript errors in RadioGroup.tsx
- ✅ Export errors resolved in PropertyFormFields.tsx
- ✅ Components ready for use

## Current Status

**RESOLVED** ✅

Both components are now properly implemented and exported. The PropertyFormFields component can now successfully import and use:
- `FormField` for form field wrappers
- `RadioGroup` and `RadioGroupItem` for radio button groups

## Next Steps

The export errors are fixed. However, the PropertyFormFields component still has many other errors related to:
- Remaining Material UI code (sx props, Radio components, etc.)
- Size prop type mismatches
- Tooltip API differences
- Other conversion artifacts

These are separate issues from the export problem and would need additional work to resolve.
