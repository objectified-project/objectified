## 7. Best Practices

### Writing Release Notes

✅ **Do:**
- Start with most exciting features
- Use clear, concise language
- Include visuals when possible
- Explain why features matter
- Link to detailed documentation
- Thank users for feedback
- Keep it positive and engaging

❌ **Don't:**
- Use technical jargon without explanation
- Write a wall of text without structure
- Forget to proofread
- Include internal-only information
- Make it too long (keep under 3 screens)

### Version Numbering

Follow semantic versioning:
- **Major** (1.0.0): Breaking changes
- **Minor** (0.1.0): New features, backwards compatible
- **Patch** (0.0.1): Bug fixes, small improvements

---

## 8. Example: Good vs. Bad

### ❌ Bad
```markdown
# v0.2.0

- Added stuff
- Fixed bugs
- Updated code
```

### ✅ Good
```markdown
# What's New in Objectified v0.2.0

## 🎉 New Features

### Export to TypeScript
You can now export your data models as TypeScript interfaces!

![Export Dialog](/images/export-typescript.png)

**How to use:**
1. Open your model in Studio
2. Click "Export" in the toolbar
3. Select "TypeScript"
4. Copy or download the generated code

This makes it easy to keep your code in sync with your models.

## 9. Troubleshooting

### Version badge shows old version
- Check both files are updated
- Restart dev server
- Clear browser cache

### Markdown not rendering
- Check syntax (use preview tool)
- Verify file saved as UTF-8
- Check for unclosed code blocks

### Images not showing
- Verify file path (relative to /public)
- Check file actually exists
- Check file permissions
- Try with just filename if in public root

### Dialog looks wrong
- Check dark mode is working
- Verify Tailwind classes are loading
- Check for console errors
- Clear browser cache
