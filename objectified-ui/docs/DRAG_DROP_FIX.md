# Drag and Drop Jumping Fix

## Issue
When dragging a property over a class node that contained properties, the drop zone indicator would rapidly show and hide, causing a "jumping" visual effect. This made it difficult to drop properties onto:
- The main class (as top-level properties)
- Properties of type "object" (as nested properties)

## Root Cause
The issue was caused by event bubbling and conflicting state updates between the class node's drag handlers and individual property drag handlers:

1. When dragging over the node, `isDragOver` state would be set to `true`
2. When the cursor moved over a property element, the property's `onDragOver` would trigger
3. The cursor leaving the main node area (entering the property) would trigger `handleDragLeave` on the node
4. This would toggle `isDragOver` back to `false`, hiding the drop zone indicator
5. As the cursor moved, this rapid toggling created the jumping effect

## Solution
Refactored the drag state management to use a single `dragTarget` state that explicitly tracks where the drag is occurring, and ensured ALL property elements handle drag events to prevent state interruption:

### State Changes
- **Before**: Used separate `isDragOver` (boolean) and `dragOverPropertyId` states
- **After**: Use unified `dragTarget` state with three possible values:
  - `null` - No drag occurring
  - `'node'` - Dragging over the class node itself (for top-level property drops)
  - `'property'` - Dragging over a specific property (for nested property drops)

### Key Improvements

1. **Explicit Target Tracking**
   ```typescript
   const [dragTarget, setDragTarget] = useState<'node' | 'property' | null>(null);
   ```

2. **Universal Property Drag Handlers**
   - ALL properties now have drag handlers (not just object types)
   - Non-object properties maintain the parent `'node'` state when hovered
   - Object properties set `'property'` state to indicate they can accept nested drops
   - This prevents DOM elements from interrupting the drag state as the cursor moves

3. **Intelligent State Handling by Property Type**
   ```typescript
   const handlePropertyDragOver = (e: React.DragEvent, propertyId: string, isObject: boolean) => {
     if (isObject) {
       // Object properties can accept nested drops
       setDragTarget('property');
       setDragOverPropertyId(propertyId);
     } else {
       // Non-object properties maintain node-level state
       setDragTarget('node');
       setDragOverPropertyId(null);
     }
   };
   ```

4. **Proper Transition Between States**
   - When entering an object property: `dragTarget` → `'property'`
   - When leaving an object property: `dragTarget` → `'node'` (if still within the node)
   - When hovering over non-object property: `dragTarget` remains `'node'`
   - When leaving the node completely: `dragTarget` → `null`

5. **Contains Check for Drag Leave**
   ```typescript
   const relatedTarget = e.relatedTarget as HTMLElement;
   const currentTarget = e.currentTarget as HTMLElement;
   
   if (!relatedTarget || !currentTarget.contains(relatedTarget)) {
     // Only clear state if truly leaving the element
   }
   ```

6. **Conditional Drop Zone Display**
   - Drop zone hint only shows when `dragTarget === 'node'`
   - Remains visible when dragging over non-object properties
   - Hides only when dragging over object properties (which show their own indicator)
   - Prevents flickering between states

## Visual Behavior

### Before Fix
```
[Drag over class node]
  ✓ "Drop property here" appears
  
[Cursor moves over property "name: string"]
  ✗ dragLeave fires on parent
  ✗ "Drop property here" DISAPPEARS (flickering starts)
  
[Cursor moves slightly within property]
  ✗ dragEnter/dragLeave fire repeatedly
  ✗ Indicator appears/disappears rapidly
```

### After Fix
```
[Drag over class node]
  ✓ "Drop property here" appears
  ✓ dragTarget = 'node'
  
[Cursor moves over property "name: string" (non-object)]
  ✓ Property's dragOver handler maintains dragTarget = 'node'
  ✓ "Drop property here" STAYS VISIBLE (no flickering)
  
[Cursor moves over property "address: object"]
  ✓ Property's dragOver handler sets dragTarget = 'property'
  ✓ "Drop property here" hides
  ✓ Property shows its own drop indicator
  
[Cursor moves back to non-object property]
  ✓ dragTarget returns to 'node'
  ✓ "Drop property here" reappears smoothly
```

## Result
- Smooth, stable drag and drop experience
- Drop zone indicator stays in one consistent state
- No more rapid showing/hiding of the "Drop property here" message
- Clear visual feedback for where the property will be dropped
- Non-object properties act as "transparent" to drag events (pass through to parent)
- Object properties show clear indication they can accept nested drops

## The Critical Insight
The final breakthrough was realizing that property `<div>` elements were creating "dead zones" in the DOM. When the cursor moved over these elements:
- They would capture drag events
- This would trigger `dragLeave` on the parent node
- The parent would clear its `dragTarget` state
- The indicator would disappear

**The solution**: Give ALL property elements drag handlers so they can maintain the appropriate state:
- Non-object properties keep `dragTarget = 'node'` (indicator stays visible)
- Object properties set `dragTarget = 'property'` (show property-specific indicator)
- No more "dead zones" that interrupt the drag state

## Files Modified
- `/objectified-ui/src/app/components/ade/studio/ClassNode.tsx`
  - Refactored drag state management
  - Added drag handlers to ALL property elements (not just object types)
  - Updated drag event handlers to be aware of property type
  - Modified conditional rendering of drop zone indicator
