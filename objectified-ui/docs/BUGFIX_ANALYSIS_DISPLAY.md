# Bug Fix: Analysis Step Not Displaying

## Issue
When clicking the "Analyze →" button on the file upload step, the step indicator would correctly move to Step 2 (Analyze), but the analysis panel content would not display.

## Root Cause
The conditional rendering logic in the ImportDialog component had TWO issues:

### Issue 1: Wrong condition order
Conditions were checking `!selectedSource` first instead of `currentStep`

### Issue 2: Incomplete condition on file upload branch  
The file upload branch was checking only `selectedSource === 'file'` instead of also checking `currentStep === 'file-upload'`

### Before (Incorrect):
```typescript
{!selectedSource ? (
  // Source selection view
) : selectedSource === 'file' ? (  // ❌ MISSING currentStep check!
  // File upload view
) : currentStep === 'analysis' && analysisResult ? (
  // Analysis panel - NEVER REACHED
) : null}
```

**Problem**: When clicking "Analyze →", the state changes to `currentStep = 'analysis'` but `selectedSource` is still `'file'`. The second condition `selectedSource === 'file'` matches, so it renders the file upload view again instead of the analysis panel.

## Solution
1. Reordered conditions to check `currentStep` first
2. Added explicit `currentStep` check to ALL branches
3. Converted to if-else pattern with logging for debugging

### After (Correct):
```typescript
{(() => {
  console.log('Render check:', { currentStep, selectedSource, hasAnalysisResult: !!analysisResult });
  
  if (currentStep === 'source') {
    return /* Source selection view */;
  } else if (currentStep === 'file-upload' && selectedSource === 'file') {
    return /* File upload view */;
  } else if (currentStep === 'analysis' && analysisResult) {
    return /* Analysis panel ✓ */;
  } else if (selectedSource) {
    return /* Placeholder */;
  } else {
    return null;
  }
})()}
```

**Solution**: Now each step has an explicit check:
1. `currentStep === 'source'` → Source selection
2. `currentStep === 'file-upload' && selectedSource === 'file'` → File upload  
3. `currentStep === 'analysis' && analysisResult` → Analysis panel ✓
4. Fallback for other sources

## Files Modified
- `/Users/kenji/Development/objectified/objectified-ui/src/app/components/ade/dashboard/ImportDialog.tsx`

## Changes Made

### 1. Line ~200-210: Converted to IIFE with logging
Changed from ternary operators to if-else return pattern wrapped in an IIFE (Immediately Invoked Function Expression) for better debugging

### 2. Line ~340: Fixed file upload condition  
Changed from `selectedSource === 'file'` to `currentStep === 'file-upload' && selectedSource === 'file'`

### 3. Line ~460-470: Analysis condition now reachable
The analysis condition is now properly evaluated because previous conditions are more specific

### 4. Added comprehensive logging
Each render logs:
- Current state values
- Which branch is being executed
- Analysis process steps

## Debugging Console Output

When working correctly, you should see:
```
Render check: { currentStep: 'source', selectedSource: null, hasAnalysisResult: false }
Rendering: Source selection

// After clicking File Upload:
Render check: { currentStep: 'file-upload', selectedSource: 'file', hasAnalysisResult: false }
Rendering: File upload

// After clicking Analyze:
Starting analysis... { selectedFile: 'petstore.yaml' }
File content loaded, length: 12543
Analysis complete: { isValid: true, format: 'openapi', ... }
State updated to analysis step
Render check: { currentStep: 'analysis', selectedSource: 'file', hasAnalysisResult: true }
Rendering: Analysis panel
```

## Result
✅ Analysis panel now correctly displays when clicking "Analyze →"  
✅ Step indicator correctly shows Step 2 as active  
✅ Quality metrics, format detection, and warnings display properly  
✅ Navigation between steps works correctly  
✅ Console logs help debug any future issues

## Testing
1. ✅ Open browser console (F12)
2. ✅ Select File Upload source
3. ✅ Upload an OpenAPI file (.yaml or .json)
4. ✅ Click "Analyze →" button
5. ✅ Check console for "Rendering: Analysis panel" message
6. ✅ Verify analysis panel displays with metrics
7. ✅ Click "← Back" returns to file upload
8. ✅ Click "Analyze →" again works correctly
