# Descriptive Progress Bar Update

## Overview

Enhanced the canvas loading progress bar to provide more descriptive, stage-by-stage feedback during all loading and updating operations. Users now see exactly what operation is being performed at each stage instead of generic "Loading..." messages.

## Changes Made

### 1. Initial Canvas Load (useEffect)

Updated the main canvas loading effect to show 7 distinct stages:

1. **"Loading classes from database..."** - When fetching class definitions
2. **"Loading properties for X classes..."** - When fetching properties (shows actual count)
3. **"Creating canvas nodes..."** - When converting classes to React Flow nodes
4. **"Creating relationship edges..."** - When building edges for references
5. **"Applying auto-layout..."** - When running the layout algorithm
6. **"Generating OpenAPI specification..."** - When creating the OpenAPI spec
7. **"Fitting view to canvas..."** - When adjusting the viewport

### 2. Canvas Refresh (reloadClasses)

Updated the reload function to show 4 distinct stages:

1. **"Refreshing canvas..."** - Starting the reload
2. **"Reloading properties..."** - Fetching updated property data
3. **"Updating nodes and edges..."** - Regenerating canvas elements
4. **"Regenerating OpenAPI specification..."** - Updating the OpenAPI spec

### 3. Property Add (handlePropertyDrop)

Updated property drop handler to show 3 distinct stages:

1. **"Property added, updating canvas..."** - After successful database update
2. **"Reloading properties..."** - Fetching updated properties
3. **"Updating canvas layout..."** - Regenerating nodes, edges, and layout

### 4. Property Remove (handlePropertyDelete)

Updated property delete handler to show 3 distinct stages:

1. **"Property removed, updating canvas..."** - After successful database update
2. **"Reloading properties..."** - Fetching updated properties
3. **"Updating canvas layout..."** - Regenerating nodes, edges, and layout

## Benefits

### User Experience
- **Transparency**: Users know exactly what's happening at each stage
- **Patience**: Descriptive messages help users understand why operations take time
- **Debugging**: Makes it easier to identify where slowdowns occur
- **Confidence**: Users see continuous progress instead of generic loading

### Developer Experience
- **Monitoring**: Easy to identify which stages are slow
- **Debugging**: Clear indication of where errors might occur
- **Maintainability**: Self-documenting code through descriptive messages

## Example User Journey

When a user selects a version with 15 classes:

```
Loading classes from database...
↓
Loading properties for 15 classes...
↓
Creating canvas nodes...
↓
Creating relationship edges...
↓
Applying auto-layout...
↓
Generating OpenAPI specification...
↓
Fitting view to canvas...
↓
[Canvas fully loaded]
```

When a user adds a property to a class:

```
Property added, updating canvas...
↓
Reloading properties...
↓
Updating canvas layout...
↓
[Canvas updated]
```

## Technical Details

### State Management
- Uses existing `isLoadingCanvas` and `loadingMessage` state
- No new state variables needed
- Minimal performance impact

### Performance
- Messages update between async operations
- No additional delays introduced
- UI updates are lightweight

### Consistency
- All canvas loading operations now use descriptive messages
- Follows consistent naming patterns
- Easy to extend for new operations

## Files Modified

1. **`/objectified-ui/src/app/ade/studio/page.tsx`**
