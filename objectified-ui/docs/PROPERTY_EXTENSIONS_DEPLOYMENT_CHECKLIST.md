# Push to repository
git push origin <branch-name>
```

### 2. Build Verification
```bash
# Install dependencies (if needed)
npm install

# Run build
npm run build

# Check for build errors
# Expected: Build completes successfully with no errors
```

### 3. Development Testing

#### Test 1: Add Property with Extensions
- [ ] Create a new class in the ADE Studio
- [ ] Add a new property to the class
- [ ] Scroll to Extensions section at bottom of property form
- [ ] Add extension: Key=`x-test`, Value=`"test-value"`
- [ ] Click "Add" button
- [ ] Verify extension appears in list
- [ ] Click "Save" to save the property
- [ ] Re-open the property for editing
- [ ] Verify extension is still present
- [ ] Generate OpenAPI spec
- [ ] Verify `x-test: "test-value"` appears in property schema

#### Test 2: Edit Existing Property Extensions
- [ ] Open an existing property for editing
- [ ] Add a new extension: Key=`x-new-field`, Value=`true`
- [ ] Save the property
- [ ] Re-open property
- [ ] Verify new extension is present
- [ ] Remove the extension by clicking delete icon
- [ ] Save the property
- [ ] Re-open property
- [ ] Verify extension was removed

#### Test 3: Extension Validation
- [ ] Try to add extension without "x-" prefix
- [ ] Verify error message appears
- [ ] Try to add extension with invalid characters (e.g., `x-test field`)
- [ ] Verify error message appears
- [ ] Try to add duplicate extension key
- [ ] Verify error message appears
- [ ] Add valid extension and verify success

#### Test 4: Different Value Types
- [ ] Add string extension: `x-string: "test"`
- [ ] Add number extension: `x-number: 42`
- [ ] Add boolean extension: `x-boolean: true`
- [ ] Add object extension: `x-object: {"key": "value"}`
- [ ] Add array extension: `x-array: ["item1", "item2"]`
- [ ] Save and re-open property
- [ ] Verify all extensions are correctly preserved
- [ ] Generate OpenAPI spec
- [ ] Verify all types are correctly represented in output

#### Test 5: Different Property Types
- [ ] Test with string property
- [ ] Test with number property
- [ ] Test with boolean property
- [ ] Test with array property
- [ ] Test with object property
- [ ] Test with property that has $ref
- [ ] Verify extensions work correctly for all types

#### Test 6: ClassPropertyEditDialog
- [ ] Open a class property for editing (different dialog)
- [ ] Add extensions using the same UI
- [ ] Verify same functionality as PropertyDialog
- [ ] Save and verify persistence

#### Test 7: OpenAPI Output
- [ ] Create property with multiple extensions
- [ ] Generate OpenAPI spec in JSON format
- [ ] Verify extensions appear in correct location
- [ ] Generate OpenAPI spec in YAML format
- [ ] Verify extensions appear in correct format
- [ ] Export the spec
- [ ] Verify exported file includes extensions

### 4. Integration Testing

#### Test 8: Version Management
- [ ] Create property with extensions
- [ ] Publish the version
- [ ] Clone the version
- [ ] Verify extensions are preserved in cloned version

#### Test 9: Import/Export
- [ ] Export OpenAPI spec with property extensions
- [ ] Import the spec into a new project
- [ ] Verify property extensions are imported correctly

#### Test 10: Backwards Compatibility
- [ ] Open existing properties (created before this feature)
- [ ] Verify they open and edit correctly
- [ ] Add extensions to existing properties
- [ ] Verify no issues with legacy data

## Post-Deployment Verification

### Functional Verification
- [ ] All Test 1-10 items passed
- [ ] No console errors in browser
- [ ] No network errors
- [ ] UI renders correctly
- [ ] Performance is acceptable

### Documentation Verification
- [ ] Documentation links work
- [ ] Examples in documentation are accurate
- [ ] Quick reference guide is accessible

### User Notification
- [ ] Update changelog
- [ ] Notify team of new feature
- [ ] Share documentation links
- [ ] Provide training if needed

## Rollback Plan

If critical issues are found:

1. **Immediate Rollback**
   ```bash
   git revert <commit-hash>
   git push origin <branch-name>
   npm run build
   # Deploy reverted version
   ```

2. **Data Integrity**
   - Existing properties without extensions: No impact
   - Properties with extensions: Extensions will be ignored but preserved in database
   - No data loss on rollback

3. **User Communication**
   - Notify users of temporary unavailability
   - Provide timeline for fix
   - Document issues found

## Success Criteria

### Minimum Requirements (Must Pass)
- [x] Code compiles without errors
- [ ] No console errors in development environment
- [ ] Extensions can be added to properties
- [ ] Extensions persist after save
- [ ] Extensions appear in OpenAPI output
- [ ] No breaking changes to existing functionality

### Desired Requirements (Should Pass)
- [ ] All 10 test scenarios pass
- [ ] Documentation is clear and complete
- [ ] Performance impact is negligible
- [ ] User feedback is positive

## Known Limitations

1. **No Bulk Operations**: Extensions must be added one at a time
2. **No Presets**: No predefined extension templates
3. **No Search**: Cannot search through extensions when many exist
4. **No Import**: Cannot import extensions from JSON file

These limitations are acceptable for v1 and can be addressed in future updates.

## Support Plan

### User Support
- [ ] Monitor support channels for questions
- [ ] Prepare FAQ based on common questions
- [ ] Update documentation based on user feedback

### Bug Tracking
- [ ] Create issue template for extension-related bugs
- [ ] Tag issues appropriately
- [ ] Prioritize based on severity

### Future Enhancements
- [ ] Collect feature requests
- [ ] Evaluate priority based on user needs
- [ ] Plan for v2 improvements

## Sign-Off

### Technical Lead
- [ ] Code review completed
- [ ] Tests passed
- [ ] Documentation approved

### Product Owner
- [ ] Feature meets requirements
- [ ] User stories completed
- [ ] Ready for deployment

### QA Lead
- [ ] Test plan executed
- [ ] Critical bugs resolved
- [ ] Acceptable quality level
