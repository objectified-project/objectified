# Import Flow Implementation - Step 1a (File Upload View)

## Overview
Implemented Step 1a of the import flow as specified in FEATURE_ROADMAP.md section 4.11. This provides a detailed file upload interface when the user selects the "File Upload" source option.

## Date
December 22, 2024

## Changes Made

### Updated ImportDialog Component
**File**: `/Users/kenji/Development/objectified/objectified-ui/src/app/components/ade/dashboard/ImportDialog.tsx`

#### New Features Implemented:

##### 1. State Management
Added state variables for file upload functionality:
- `isDragging`: Tracks drag-over state for visual feedback
- `selectedFile`: Stores the selected file object

**Note**: Upload options (resolve refs, include referenced files, convert Swagger) have been removed and will be implemented as the import flow design progresses.

##### 2. File Handling Functions
- `handleDragEnter()`: Activates drag state when file enters drop zone
- `handleDragLeave()`: Deactivates drag state when file leaves drop zone
- `handleDragOver()`: Prevents default behavior during drag
- `handleDrop()`: Handles file drop event and validates file type
- `handleFileSelect()`: Validates and stores selected file (supports .yaml, .yml, .json, .zip)
- `handleFileInputChange()`: Handles file selection from browse button
- `handleBack()`: Returns to source selection view

##### 3. Step 1a UI Components

###### Source Tab Navigation
Horizontal tab bar showing all 6 source options:
- 📁 File (active)
- 🔗 URL (disabled)
- 📋 Clipboard (disabled)
- 🐙 Git (disabled)
- ☁️ SwaggerHub (disabled)
- 📦 Registry (disabled)

Active tab indicated with:
- Blue bottom border
- Blue text color

**Note**: Other import source tabs (URL, Clipboard, Git, SwaggerHub, Registry) are currently disabled until file import functionality is completed. They are visible but not clickable, with:
- Gray text color
- Reduced opacity (50%)
- `cursor-not-allowed` cursor style
- "Coming soon" tooltip on hover

###### Drag-and-Drop Upload Zone
Features:
- Large dashed border rectangle
- Visual feedback on drag (border turns blue, background lightens)
- Upload icon (changes color on drag)
- "Drop files here or" text
- "Browse Files" button (styled as primary action)
- Supported file types listed below: ".yaml, .yml, .json, .zip"

When file is selected:
- Shows file icon with filename
- Displays file size in KB
- Shows "Remove file" button to clear selection

##### 4. Conditional Rendering
The dialog now shows different views based on state:
- **No source selected**: Shows source selection grid
- **File source selected**: Shows Step 1a file upload view
- **Other sources selected**: Shows placeholder (for future implementation)

**Note**: Recent Imports section has been removed as it's impractical for file-based imports across different browsers or sessions.

##### 5. Updated Footer Buttons
Footer adapts based on view:

**Source Selection View:**
- Cancel button (left)
- Next → button (right, disabled until source selected)

**File Upload View:**
- ← Back button (left, returns to source selection)
- Cancel button (center)
- Next → button (right, disabled until file selected)

## UI/UX Design Alignment

The implementation matches the ASCII mockup from FEATURE_ROADMAP.md section 4.11:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  [📁 File] [🔗 URL] [📋 Clipboard] [🐙 Git] [☁️ SwaggerHub] [📦 Registry]   │
│  ─────────                                                                  │
│  ┌ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ┐ │
│  │         📄 Drop files here or [Browse Files]                          │ │
│  │         Supports: .yaml, .yml, .json, .zip                            │ │
│  └ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ┘ │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Note**: Upload options section has been removed. Options will be implemented as the import flow is designed.

### Implemented Elements:
✅ Source tabs with active state indicator  
✅ Disabled state for other import sources (URL, Clipboard, Git, SwaggerHub, Registry)  
✅ Drag-and-drop file upload zone  
✅ Visual feedback during drag operations  
✅ Browse files button  
✅ Supported file types display  
✅ Selected file display with name and size  
✅ Remove file functionality  
✅ Back button to return to source selection  
✅ Disabled Next button until file is selected  

## Technical Details

### File Validation
- Accepts: `.yaml`, `.yml`, `.json`, `.zip` files
- Validates file extension before accepting
- Displays file size in KB when selected
- Provides remove functionality

### Drag-and-Drop Implementation
- Uses HTML5 drag-and-drop API
- Prevents default browser behavior
- Visual feedback with border and background color changes
- Supports both drag-and-drop and traditional file browser

### State Persistence
- Selected file state maintained during view
- Upload options state maintained
- State cleared on dialog close or back navigation

### Accessibility
- Checkbox inputs with proper labels
- Hidden file input with label wrapper for styling
- Keyboard-accessible buttons and controls
- Proper semantic HTML structure

## Next Steps

### Future Implementations:
1. **Step 1b**: URL Import View (when URL tab is clicked)
2. **Step 1c**: Clipboard Paste View
3. **Step 1d**: Git Repository View
4. **Step 1e**: SwaggerHub Integration View
5. **Step 1f**: Registry Import View
6. **File Upload Processing**: Actually upload and parse the file
7. **Error Handling**: Display validation errors for invalid files
8. **Progress Indication**: Show upload progress for large files

### Functional Integration:
- Connect to file upload API endpoint
- Parse OpenAPI/JSON Schema files
- Validate file format and structure
- Extract schema information for Step 2 (Analysis)
- Handle zip files and extract contents
- Implement external $ref resolution
- Implement Swagger 2.0 to OpenAPI 3.0 conversion

## Testing Recommendations

### Visual Testing:
1. Verify tab navigation displays correctly
2. Test drag-and-drop visual feedback
3. Confirm file selection display
4. Check checkbox states and descriptions
5. Validate button states (enabled/disabled)
6. Test dark mode appearance

### Interaction Testing:
1. Click each source tab to verify view switching
2. Drag a file over the drop zone
3. Drop a valid file (.yaml, .json, etc.)
4. Drop an invalid file and verify handling
5. Click Browse Files and select a file
6. Toggle each checkbox option
7. Click Remove file button
8. Click Back button to return to source selection
9. Verify Next button is disabled without file selection

### Edge Cases:
1. Drop multiple files (should only accept first)
2. Drop invalid file types
3. Large file handling
4. Special characters in filenames
5. Files with no extension

## Styling & Design

### Color Scheme:
- Primary: Indigo/Purple gradient
- Success: Green (for selected file)
- Error: Red (for remove/errors)
- Neutral: Gray shades for borders and text

### Interactive States:
- Hover: Border color change, background lightening
- Active/Selected: Blue theme, shadow effects
- Disabled: Gray with reduced opacity, no pointer events
- Drag-over: Blue border and background tint

### Responsive Behavior:
- **Viewport-based height** (60vh for content area) adapts to screen size automatically
- Dialog max-height set to 90vh to prevent page scrolling
- Content scrolls when it exceeds the viewport-based height
- Tab bar wraps on smaller screens (via flex)
- Upload zone maintains aspect ratio
- Button layout adjusts for mobile (future)

**Technical Note**: To ensure the dialog maintains a consistent size across different screens:
- DialogContent uses `max-h-[90vh]` to constrain to 90% of viewport height
- Scrollable content area uses `h-[60vh]` (60% of viewport height)
- No fixed pixel heights - everything scales with screen size
- The `overflow-y-auto` enables scrolling when content exceeds available space
- This prevents the dialog from resizing when switching between Step 1 (source selection) and Step 1a (file upload) views
- Viewport units ensure the dialog never causes page-level scrolling
