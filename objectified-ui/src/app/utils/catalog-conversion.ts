/**
 * Types and presentation helpers for a catalog item's convert-to-OpenAPI back-link (MFI-23.11, #4020).
 *
 * Once a catalog item has been converted (the MFI-EPIC-22 fidelity-preview → convert flow), the REST
 * catalog list/detail responses carry a `conversion` object projected from the conversion-provenance
 * ledger (MFI-22.5): the publishable Project it produced, that Project's name/slug (or a `projectDeleted`
 * flag if it was since removed), the produced revision, whether the latest conversion was a re-convert,
 * and the fidelity grade/tier. The Catalog card and detail render this as **"Converted → {project}"**
 * with a link, and the convert action relabels to **"Re-convert to OpenAPI"**.
 *
 * These helpers are pure (no React, no fetch) so they can be unit-tested and reused by the card, the
 * table row, and the detail view.
