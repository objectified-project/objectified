/**
 * catalog-revision-diff (MFI-28.1, #4117) — the "compare read" behind the inline version diff in the
 * catalog detail Versions tab.
 *
 * The catalog reuses the **exact same** machinery the versions dashboard uses to diff two revisions:
 * it builds each revision's canonical OpenAPI spec JSON via the `buildOpenApiSpecJsonForVersion`
 * server action (see `objectified-ui/src/app/ade/dashboard/versions/page.tsx` `loadVersionSpec` →
 * `runCompareBetween`) and diffs the two pretty-printed strings. No new endpoints are introduced — the
 * two revisions are rendered side-by-side/unified in the shared Monaco diff viewer instead of routing
 * away to the dashboard.
 *
 * Isolating the server-action call here keeps `CatalogVersionsPanel` a thin view and gives its jest
 * tests a single module to mock (the action needs the server DB, so it never runs under jsdom).
