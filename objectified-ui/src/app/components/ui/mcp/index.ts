/**
 * Shared MCP UI primitives (V2-MCP-24.7 / MCAT-10.7).
 *
 * The token-driven component library every MCP catalog screen reuses — the grade glyph, the
 * tone-based badge, health & recency pills, the finding-severity chip, and the detail tab shell.
 * Pair these React components with the pure mapping helpers in
 * `@/app/components/ade/dashboard/mcp/mcpUiPrimitives` (tones, grade styles, health/recency, tab
 * definitions) so consumers pass domain values, never colors or spacing.
