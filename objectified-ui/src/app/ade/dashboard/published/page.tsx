// time, so a client component cannot pick up a runtime override — when the Docker
// image is built without the var, the client would forever use the localhost
// fallback (the bug behind "Swagger UI" / "View" links pointing at localhost:8000).
// `force-dynamic` guarantees this runs per-request rather than being prerendered
// (and frozen) at build time.
