## New Features and Improvements

- New Features:
  - Added new Application Dashboard landing page - presents all Objectified applications in an organized tile layout.
  - Added interactive quality score cards during import - click on any quality score card for more details.
  - Added Chart View tab in import preview - shows a diagram before importing, showing how classes relate to each other through references.
  - Added AI-Powered Import - Generate OpenAPI 3.1.0 specifications using natural language with real-time streaming responses and conversational context.
- Bug fixes:
  - Fixed ClassNode color changes not being reflected immediately - the memo comparison function now correctly detects theme changes to trigger re-renders.
  - Fixed expand/collapse chevrons in ClassNode not responding - the memo comparison function now correctly detects expandedProperties changes.
  - Improves drag/drop behavior in class nodes.
  - Fixed property template list to show [optional] when nullable is selected.
  - Fixed property to show numeric precision when applicable.
  - Fixed canvas reload/reposition issue when adding or removing properties to a class.
  - Fixed composition handles (allOf/oneOf/anyOf) not repositioning when ClassNode height changes due to property list changes.
  - Fixed auto-layout to treat groups as single units - grouped classes maintain their exact relative positions within the group.
  - Fixed group member nodes jumping after auto-layout when dragging the group - properly synchronizes group position reference.
  - Fixed response nodes in path canvas - clicking a response node now shows the ResponsePropertiesPanel with existing description loaded for editing.
  - Fixed JSON Schema refs, was #/components/schemas, but this needs to be #/$defs according to the spec.
  - Fixed Canvas Layout option so that Load is only available if a previous layout has been saved.
  - Class Template Library now shows the schema preview.
  - Properties and Class Template Form now includes a "close" button
  - Properties now allow multiple properties to be added without closing the form.
  - Properties Template Form now shows the inline properties when an "object" type is selected.
  - Condensed property flags into a compact horizontal layout.
  - Class node styling changes were not persisting properly, this is now fixed.
  - Removed Level of Detail settings, was causing confusion.
- Code Generation:
  - Added GraphQL - added support for input types, enums, and interfaces.
  - Added SQL DDL - added support for indexes, constraints, and foreign keys.
  - Added AsyncAPI 3.0.0 - generate event-driven API specifications with channels, messages, operations, and schema definitions for Kafka, AMQP, MQTT, WebSocket, and HTTP protocols.
