We continue to improve the platform based on your feedback with improvements and new features!

## Repositories
- Added repository connector MVP database tables for repository registration, branch tracking, and linked-account credential references.
- Added a provider abstraction layer for repository connectors with a GitHub adapter, shared provider error taxonomy, and cross-provider contract tests.
- Added a GitLab repository provider (`@gitbeaker/rest`) with full contract support, keyset repository pagination, and GitLab webhook secret verification.
- Added a Bitbucket Cloud repository provider adapter with contract-test coverage, REST API 2.0 tree/file handling, and UUID-based webhook verification.
- Added a server-only `resolveRepositoryToken` helper that resolves linked-account repository credentials, refreshes supported expired tokens, emits typed resolver errors, and writes token-safe workflow audit rows.
- Added a new ADE Repositories page with a four-step GitHub registration wizard and initial scan timeline flow.
- Added per-repository branch management so tracked branches can be added/removed with per-branch subpath glob and polling settings, defaulting to the provider default branch and supporting wildcard branch patterns.
- Added repository lifecycle management for edit/archive/unarchive/delete with typed delete confirmation, dashboard controls, and REST audit/cascade handling.

## UI
- Branch workflow is its own button in the canvas now, and compacted to fit most functionality that's in Versions now.
- Compacted the trending view in the projects page in the dashboard.
- Moved the add, import, and template buttons to the bottom of the classes and properties sidebar list so they don't obscure the lists.
- Added bottom header to show status of the canvas editor screens.
- Gitlike functionality will be redesigned; currently not working as expected, and will be perfected in a later release.
- Clicking on the warning chevron now eases in/out the warning for the project for sunset indicators.
- Clicking the tools chevron in the designer canvas now animates instead of just (dis)appearing.
- Layout form now looks associated with the button from which it appears.
- Clicking outside the layout form now dismisses it from the canvas.
- Added the ability to decide whether or not to save the layout image on a layout persist.
- Corrects schema metrics display when the schema list is empty.
- Corrects opacity of overlay buttons in canvas.

## Studio AI
- Added the Studio AI chatbot launcher and panel: a floating bubble in the bottom right of the canvas opens a slide-out panel with full-screen mode, toggled with `Cmd+Shift+A` / `Ctrl+Shift+A`.
- Filled out the Studio AI chat surface to the design guidelines: distinct user/assistant bubbles, typing indicator, markdown rendering, syntax-highlighted code blocks with a copy button, regenerate / thumbs up / thumbs down message actions, and a one-click import button when an assistant reply contains an OpenAPI spec in a ```json``` block.
- The Studio AI chatbot is now context-aware: each message you send carries a snapshot of your current project, version, classes, reusable properties, and canvas selection, and a "Sharing context" chip in the panel lets you inspect exactly what the assistant can see.
- The Studio AI chatbot now handles multi-turn conversations: follow-up prompts like "add a phone field", "remove priceCents", "make name required", "rename id to productId", "make it more like Stripe Charges", or simple clarification questions are recognized as edits to the previous reply, and the refined OpenAPI spec is re-shipped so you can keep iterating without restarting the thread.
- The Studio AI chatbot now persists conversations per project and version: a new toolbar above the chat surfaces "New", "History", "Export", and "Clear" actions, the history view lets you browse and search every saved thread, exporting downloads the active conversation as a markdown file, and the chat automatically restores your most recent thread when you reopen the panel.
