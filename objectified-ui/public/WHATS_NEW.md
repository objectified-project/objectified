## Studio
- AI chatbot lists Ollama models from your server and lets you pick which model answers each conversation (falls back to the offline assistant when Ollama is unavailable).
- Studio chatbot remembers your preferred Ollama tag per project (and per tenant), with an optional control to set a tenant-wide default when you are inside a project.
- Studio AI chat streams Ollama replies over SSE so assistant text appears incrementally as the model generates.
- Studio AI chat shows live token usage (estimated while streaming, then Ollama-reported counts when each reply finishes).
- Studio AI chat includes **Stop** while a reply is generating so you can cancel mid-stream; partial text is kept when the model had already streamed content.
- Studio AI chat shows an indeterminate progress bar while the assistant is generating a reply.
- Identical Ollama chat requests are served from an in-memory exact-match cache when a prior reply completed successfully, reducing load on your model server (disable with `OLLAMA_CHAT_CACHE_DISABLED`).
